[{"body": " (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The Democratic presidential candidates are debating for the second time in the 2016 nomination contest, this time in Des Moines.\nThe latest developments (all times local):\n___\n10:30 p.m.\nHillary Rodham Clinton is joining a raucous audience of about 750 people in Drake University's union after the second Democratic debate for a quick campaign rally.\nThe event lacks any the solemnity that she and her two rivals showed at the start of the debate when they observed a moment of silence in the wake of the Paris attacks.\nClinton is imploring those in the mostly college-age audience to redouble their work for her campaign.\nShe says, \"Because this is just the beginning. I need you on caucus night. Then I need you in November.\"\n___\n10:15 p.m.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is greeting roughly 500 supporters who gathered at a movie theater near the site of the second Democratic debate.\n\"You killed it!\" one man yelled as Sanders took the stage.\nSanders is with his wife and three of his four children. He's thanking the crowd and repeating his argument that they are working for \"real political revolution.\"\nHe tells the cheering crowd, \"If we work hard, I believe we're going to win Iowa.\"\nAsked about the debate Sanders says, \"I think it went great.\"\n___\n10 p.m.\nAnd the second debate of the Democratic campaign for president has come to an end with closing statements.\nMartin O'Malley is pitching himself as a new leader, asking voters to discard the \"divisive ideologies of our past\" and \"polarizing figures from our past.\"\nThe former Maryland governor says he can create an economy that works for all and identify foreign threats before they \"back us into military corners.\"\nHillary Rodham Clinton turns attention back to economic issues in her closing statement.\nShe says that, \"ultimately, I think the president's job is to do everything possible, everything that she can do, to lift up the people of the country.\"\nSanders closes the debate by again calling for a \"political revolution,\" saying it is unacceptable for the U.S. to have a \"corrupt\" campaign finance system, no universal health care, high childhood poverty and no guaranteed paid family medical leave.\nHe says, \"That's not the America that I think we should be.\"\n___\n9:51 p.m.\nAsked about his greatest test, Bernie Sanders cites his work on veterans' health care in the wake of the Veterans Administration scandal \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and not getting everything he wanted in his reform bill.\nSanders is the co-author of a veterans' health care reform bill with GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona.\nThe legislation has been widely praised, but Sanders says it's far from the bill he initially penned. Sanders says he was forced to go back to the drawing board after his initial legislation didn't receive enough votes.\nThat moment, he says, represented a challenge he overcame.\n___\n9:49 p.m.\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley is pointing to no single crisis during his tenure as comparing to those that a president would face.\nHis reason? Because he says there is no test is like what he would face as president.\nO'Malley says: \"I can tell you that as a mayor and as a governor that I learned many disciplines. ... I've been tried over many emergencies.\"\n___\n9:48 p.m.\nThe Democratic candidates for president are answering a question about their greatest test and how it would prepare them for the rigors of serving in the White House.\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton points to the deliberations over killing Osama bin Laden.\nClinton says being \"part of a very small group\" advising President Barack Obama on the matter \"really did give me an insight into the very difficult problems presidents face.\"\nShe says she advocated pursuing the assassination mission, despite intelligence she says \"was by no means absolute.\"\nClinton adds that \"there was no one to talk to\" outside the circle of advisers who had access to the intelligence and discussions. That includes her husband, former President Bill Clinton.\n___\n9:45 p.m.\nBernie Sanders says single-payer health insurance is the only way to go. But Hillary Rodham Clinton argues that she once thought this would happen and that \"revolution never came.\"\nThe Vermont senator and former secretary of state are clashing over health care in the second Democratic debate.\nSanders says changing to a single-payer system would take time but that it can happen \"when millions of people stand up and agree to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies.\"\nClinton retorts that Sanders' plans would put too much power in the hands of the states.\nShe adds at the debate in Des Moines that \"if I lived in Iowa, I would not want Terry Branstad administering my health care.\"\nBranstad is the Republican governor of Iowa.\n___\n9: 40 p.m.\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley is making an impassioned case for debt-free college and railing against high interest rates for federal student loans.\nO'Malley often cites his own daughter's college debt when he talks about lowering college costs.\nHe says he is proud of his daughters going to college and adds, \"but we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our natural lives. It doesn't need to be that way.\"\nHe says, \"It doesn't need to be that way.\"\nO'Malley's debt-free college plan centers in part on getting states to contribute more to public colleges and universities.\n___\n9:35 p.m.\nHillary Rodham Clinton is turning a discussion about her emails into a broad-ranging attack on Republicans.\nShe says, \"I do think it's important to do exactly what Sen. Sanders said, and that is to start talking about the issues that the American people really care about.\"\nShe says that there are \"differences among us\" on the Democratic debate stage. But, she adds, \"they pale compared to what's happening on the Republican side.\"\nClinton then puts forth a list of what she calls \"alarming plans.\"\nShe says, \"All of us support funding Planned Parenthood. All of us believe climate change is real. All of us want equal pay for equal work. They don't believe in any of that. So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about.\"\n___\n9:30 p.m.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders still doesn't care about Hillary Rodham Clinton's emails.\nSanders suggested in a recent interview that the investigation into Clinton's use of a private email account and server while serving as secretary of state had merit.\nBut asked about that interview at the second Democratic debate, he jabs the media.\nSanders says, \"That's just media stuff. I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email. I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email.\"\nSanders says it's time to move on, and Clinton seizes the opening to add, \"I couldn't agree more.\"\nAsked if she can promise the country that another shoe won't drop in the email story, she points to her recent testimony before Congress when she was questioned about the issue.\nShe says, \"I think after 11 hours, that's pretty clear.\"\n___\n9:25 p.m.\nBernie Sanders say the \"political revolution\" he's trying to create can overpower a GOP-led Congress that he argues is beholden to big-money interests.\nAnd he's downplaying the idea that Congress doesn't always listen to what the majority of Americans want.\nHe says most Americans want to improve infrastructure and raise the minimum wage. He claims that if people \"stand up and fight back\" they can take on corporate lobbyists and change the tone in Washington.\nHe says, \"Enough is enough. This government belongs to us, not just the billionaires.\"\n___\n9:20 p.m.\nWhile the Democratic candidates agree on many issues, Martin O'Malley is stressing their differences on guns.\nDuring the second Democratic debate, the former Maryland governor is highlighting his record in passing gun safety legislation.\nHe questions Sanders' support for a 2005 measure to give gun manufacturers immunity from lawsuits. O'Malley also says that rival Hillary Rodham Clinton has been on \"three sides of this issue.\"\nHe says, \"When you ran in 2000, you said we needed federal robust regulation, then in 2008 you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying we don't need those regulations ... and now you've come back around here.\"\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders chimes in to note that Baltimore \"is not now one of the safest cities in America.\"\nO'Malley is the former mayor of Baltimore, which recorded its 300th homicide of the year on Saturday.\n___\n9:10 p.m.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders says the business model of Wall Street is \"fraud.\"\nHe pledges that no one from Wall Street will advise him on economic policy if he's elected president.\nSanders is challenging Hillary Rodham Clinton on her ties to Wall Street as he promises to aggressively take on and break up the nation's largest banks.\nHe says Wall Street has dominated Republican and Democratic presidential administrations.\nHe is chiding Clinton for suggesting that Wall Street bankers will play by the rules. He says the big banks operate through \"greed and fraud.\"\nHe says, \"Who are we kidding? The business model of Wall Street is fraud, that's what it is.\"\n___\n9:05 p.m.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is saying at the second Democratic debate that Hillary Rodham Clinton is beholden to Wall Street financial institutions and will not act strongly enough to regulate them.\nOf the plan Clinton is offering to regulate the nation's financial industry, Sanders says simply: \"Not good enough.\"\nHe continues: \"Let's not be naive about it. Why over her political career has Wall Street been the major contributor to her campaign?\"\nClinton replies sharply that as a senator from New York, she stood in Manhattan to help rebuild the financial heart of the nation after Sept. 11.\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley jumps in to call Clinton's plans \"weak tea.\"\nO'Malley says you can't be the candidate for Main Street by being \"the candidate for Wall Street.\"\n___\n9 p.m.\nHillary Rodham Clinton is deviating from her Democratic primary rivals on minimum wage.\nClinton says the federal wage floor should be raised to $12 per hour from the current $7.25. She says $15 is too high.\nThat's the wage sought by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley.\nClinton says she respects the concerns of economists and business leaders who argue such an immediate hike would lead to job losses and other negative consequences.\nSanders says he will \"apologize to no one\" for backing the $15 wage. He says that several U.S. cities already have gone to the higher level without suffering any catastrophic results.\nBoth Sanders and O'Malley argue that higher wages benefit the overall economy, because workers have more money to spend as consumers.\nO'Malley says, \"We should stop taking our advice from economists on Wall Street.\"\n___\n8:55 p.m.\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley says the United States must focus on immigration reform, rather than more border security.\nDuring the second Democratic debate, O'Malley says that that net immigration from Mexico last year was zero.\nHe says: \"Fact check me. Go ahead. Check it out.\"\nO'Malley argues that the real focus should be on providing a pathway to citizenship for those in the country illegally.\n___\n8:45 p.m.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders says he wants public college tuition to be free for all Americans and will pay for it by raising taxes, but he won't say by how much.\nSanders says, \"There must be a tax on Wall Street speculation. ... It's their turn to bail out the middle class.\"\nBut when asked specifically by how much he'll raise taxes, Sanders replies that \"we haven't come up with an exact number yet, but it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90 percent.\"\nHe zings, \"I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower.\"\nSander is a longtime independent who often calls himself a democratic socialist.\n___\n8:40 p.m.\nThe Democratic presidential debate has shifted away from foreign policy and is now focused on domestic issues.\nAnd the three Democratic candidates say they agree that wealthy citizens and corporations should pay more in taxes to benefit the middle class.\nAll say they support reducing the costs of college and paid family leave. Hillary Rodham Clinton says she'll close loopholes and eliminate deductions that benefit big corporations.\nShe says, \"I've made very clear hardworking, middle-class families need a raise, not a tax increase.\"\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley says he's the only one with a record of keeping college costs low.\nDuring his tenure as governor, Maryland's university system froze tuition for four years. He says wealthier Americans should be willing to contribute more for the benefit of everyone.\n___\n8:35 p.m.\nIn the wake of the Paris attacks, French President Francois Hollande vows that his nation will wage \"merciless\" war on the Islamic State.\nAt the Democratic debate, Hillary Rodham Clinton is deflecting a question of whether she would declare war on the militant group.\nThe former secretary says the United States has to beef up its intelligence capabilities. She says, \"It is difficult finding intelligence that is actionable, but we have to keep on trying. ... There's a lot of work we need to keep doing.\"\nHer rival Bernie Sanders interrupts, suggesting that too little of the existing U.S. military budget of $600 billion is used to fight \"international terrorism.\"\nInstead, Sanders complains that too much is spent to maintain nuclear weapons that he sees as part of the U.S. military strategy of the last century.\n___\n8:32 p.m.\nThe Republican candidates for president are jumping on the refusal of the Democratic candidates to say the words \"radical Islam\" at their debate.\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush tweets, \"Yes, we are at war with radical Islamic terrorism.\"\nRick Santorum adds on Twitter, \"@HillaryClinton how can we defeat our enemy if we cannot identify who they are and what motivates them?\"\nSays Carly Fiorina on Twitter: \"Hillary Clinton will not call this Islamic terrorism. I will.\"\n___\n8:30 p.m.\nAll three Democratic presidential candidates are declining to use the term \"radical Islam\" at the party's second debate, a description used by many of their Republican rivals.\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton says, \"I don't think we are at war with Islam. ... I think we're at war with jihadists.\"\nShe adds that \"it's not particularly helpful\" to use language that alienates many Muslims, and she notes that Republican President George W. Bush made a similar point after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders says, \"I don't think the term is important.\" He says the more important issue is the \"entire world coming together\" to defeat militants.\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley says using the term \"radical Islam\" is unnecessarily offensive to Muslims in America. He says he prefers \"radical jihadists\" and describes them as a group that is \"perverting the name of a major world religion.\"\n___\n8:25 p.m.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders says countries in the Middle East must get more involved in the fight against the Islamic State.\nDuring a foreign policy discussion during the second Democratic debate, Sanders calls the current conflict a \"war for the soul of Islam.\"\nHe says that other Muslim countries in the region will need to get \"deeply involved\" and lead the effort. He mentions Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey and Jordan by name.\nHillary Rodham Clinton calls the comment \"unfair\" to some counties, in particular Jordan. She says Jordan has \"put a lot on the line\" for the United States.\nBut Clinton says she agrees that Turkey and the Gulf nations should decide if they will stand with the United States against \"this kind of jihadi radicalism.\"\n___\n8:20 p.m.\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley says simply toppling dictators is not a suitable foreign policy for the 21st century, referring to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.\nO'Malley is attempting to draw a contrast with former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on foreign policy during the second Democratic debate.\nHe says Syria, Libya and Afghanistan are \"a mess\" and that the United States isn't doing enough to build stable democracies after toppling dictators.\nHe says the United States needs better \"human intelligence\" on the ground to understand what actors will step up to fill the void after dictators fall.\n___\n8:17 p.m.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is criticizing former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's vote as a New York senator for the resolution to allow the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nSanders says, \"I don't think any sensible person\" would have supported the use-of-force resolution.\nHe calls the invasion \"the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of the United States.\"\nClinton has said the 2002 vote was a mistake, but says there were acts leading up to the invasion that suggested Islamic extremists had struck at U.S. installations.\n___\n8:15 p.m.\nHillary Rodham Clinton is defending the Obama administration's initial approach to the rise of Islamic State, including her actions as secretary of state.\nClinton rejects the notion that she underestimated the militants, and she blames their rise on leaders in the Middle East and names former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.\nClinton says al-Maliki did not do enough to maintain stability in Iraq once the U.S. turned over control of the nation.\nShe adds that she did advocate that the U.S. do more to \"train and equip moderates\" in Syria, which has since fallen into civil war.\n___\n8:10 p.m.\nA look at the opening statements from the second presidential Democratic debate.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders begins with sharp language for the Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for the attack in Paris.\nHe says, \"Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of this barbarous organization.\"\nBut Sanders also pivots from the attacks to the economic issues that are the focus of his campaign.\nFront-runner and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton keeps to the attacks in her statement, saying \"our prayers are with the people of France tonight.\"\nShe adds: \"But that is not enough. We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical, Jihadist ideology that motivates organizations ISIS.\"\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley touts his executive experience in his opening remarks, and says the U.S. needs \"new thinking\" and \"new leadership\" to respond to threats like those posed by the Islamic State.\n___\n8 p.m.\nThe second debate of the Democratic campaign for president is underway, and it's starting with a moment of silence for the victims of the attacks in Paris.\nA coordinated gun-and-suicide bombing attack tore across Paris on Friday, leaving at least 129 people dead and 352 injured. It marked the deadliest violence on French soil since World War II.\nFrench President Francois Hollande has vowed that his country will wage \"merciless\" war on the Islamic State group, which claimed responsibility for the carnage.\nThe candidates will each make an opening statement before the debate's first section focuses on the attacks and foreign policy.\n___\n7:45 p.m.\nThe Democratic candidates for president are gathering for the party's second debate of the 2016 campaign, a meeting that will take place in the shadow of the attacks in Paris.\nThe campaigns have tangled with debate host CBS over the format of the debate in the hours before the debate.\nWhen CBS said on a conference call with the campaigns that it wanted to focus the opening statement and the first section of the debate on the Paris attacks, the campaign of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders vigorously disagreed.\nThat's according to a participant on the call, who spoke on condition of anonymity and was not authorized to speak publicly.\nSanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver says the key issue is a proposal to shorten the opening statements from 90 seconds to 30 seconds in order to move quickly to questions in a debate unfolding a day after the Paris attacks.\nThe Vermont senator's campaign says it successfully argued on behalf of the longer opening statements, which all three candidates will deliver.\nThe debate will begin with a moment of silence in memory of the victims of the attacks.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094 By Ken Thomas.", "byline": "", "description": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 The Democratic presidential candidates are debating for the second time in the 2016 nomination contest, this time in Des Moines.", "title": "The Latest: Democratic 2016 candidates meet for 2nd debate", "url": "http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-11-14-US--DEM%202016-Debate-The%20Latest/id-4e8b31b826674d8abdd6e393d15526bf", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Rick Santorum", "Jeff Weaver", "Martin O'Malley", "Francois Hollande", "Bill Clinton", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "Dwight D.

Bernie Sanders is criticizing former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's vote as a New York senator for the resolution to allow the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nSanders says, \"I don't think any sensible person\" would have supported the use-of-force resolution.\nHe calls the invasion \"the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of the United States.\"\nClinton has said the 2002 vote was a mistake, but says there were acts leading up to the invasion that suggested Islamic extremists had struck at U.S. installations.\n___\n8:15 p.m.\nHillary Rodham Clinton is defending the Obama administration's initial approach to the rise of Islamic State, including her actions as secretary of state.\nClinton rejects the notion that she underestimated the militants, and she blames their rise on leaders in the Middle East and names former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.\nClinton says al-Maliki did not do enough to maintain stability in Iraq once the U.S. turned over control of the nation.\nShe adds that she did advocate that the U.S. do more to \"train and equip moderates\" in Syria, which has since fallen into civil war.\n___\n8:10 p.m.\nA look at the opening statements from the second presidential Democratic debate.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders begins with sharp language for the Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for the attack in Paris.\nHe says, \"Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of this barbarous organization.\"\nBut Sanders also pivots from the attacks to the economic issues that are the focus of his campaign.\nFront-runner and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton keeps to the attacks in her statement, saying \"our prayers are with the people of France tonight.\"\nShe adds: \"But that is not enough. We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical, Jihadist ideology that motivates organizations ISIS.\"\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley touts his executive experience in his opening remarks, and says the U.S. needs \"new thinking\" and \"new leadership\" to respond to threats like those posed by the Islamic State.\n___\n8 p.m.\nThe second debate of the Democratic campaign for president is underway, and it's starting with a moment of silence for the victims of the attacks in Paris.\nA coordinated gun-and-suicide bombing attack tore across Paris on Friday, leaving at least 129 people dead and 352 injured. It marked the deadliest violence on French soil since World War II.\nFrench President Francois Hollande has vowed that his country will wage \"merciless\" war on the Islamic State group, which claimed responsibility for the carnage.\nThe candidates will each make an opening statement before the debate's first section focuses on the attacks and foreign policy.\n___\n7:45 p.m.\nThe Democratic candidates for president are gathering for the party's second debate of the 2016 campaign, a meeting that will take place in the shadow of the attacks in Paris.\nThe campaigns have tangled with debate host CBS over the format of the debate in the hours before the debate.\nWhen CBS said on a conference call with the campaigns that it wanted to focus the opening statement and the first section of the debate on the Paris attacks, the campaign of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders vigorously disagreed.\nThat's according to a participant on the call, who spoke on condition of anonymity and was not authorized to speak publicly.\nSanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver says the key issue is a proposal to shorten the opening statements from 90 seconds to 30 seconds in order to move quickly to questions in a debate unfolding a day after the Paris attacks.\nThe Vermont senator's campaign says it successfully argued on behalf of the longer opening statements, which all three candidates will deliver.\nThe debate will begin with a moment of silence in memory of the victims of the attacks.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094 By Ken Thomas.", "byline": "", "description": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 The Democratic presidential candidates are debating for the second time in the 2016 nomination contest, this time in Des Moines.", "title": "The Latest: Democratic 2016 candidates meet for 2nd debate", "url": "http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2015-11-14-US--DEM%202016-Debate-The%20Latest/id-c207d2f4dca145cd98e4b8cca2bedfe2", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Rick Santorum", "Jeff Weaver", "Martin O'Malley", "Francois Hollande", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "Dwight D.

In recent weeks, she has called for a more aggressive U.S. role in the Syrian conflict, including a no-fly zone over the area, a move the Obama administration opposes.

But she is vulnerable, too, her tenure tied to that of Obama, who's struggled to contain the threat from Islamic militants in Syria and associated terror attacks across the globe.\nThe candidates were meeting in the shadow of the Paris attacks that killed at least 129 and wounded at least 352 people.

Sanders envisions a \"single-payer\" system that would be run by the states under federal rules.\nEven as the field responded somberly to the deadly attacks in Paris, the debate Saturday night marked a feistier phase in the Democratic campaign.
