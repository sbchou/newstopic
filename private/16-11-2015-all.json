{"body": " (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The Democratic presidential candidates are debating for the second time in the 2016 nomination contest, this time in Des Moines.\nThe latest developments (all times local):\n___\n10:30 p.m.\nHillary Rodham Clinton is joining a raucous audience of about 750 people in Drake University's union after the second Democratic debate for a quick campaign rally.\nThe event lacks any the solemnity that she and her two rivals showed at the start of the debate when they observed a moment of silence in the wake of the Paris attacks.\nClinton is imploring those in the mostly college-age audience to redouble their work for her campaign.\nShe says, \"Because this is just the beginning. I need you on caucus night. Then I need you in November.\"\n___\n10:15 p.m.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is greeting roughly 500 supporters who gathered at a movie theater near the site of the second Democratic debate.\n\"You killed it!\" one man yelled as Sanders took the stage.\nSanders is with his wife and three of his four children. He's thanking the crowd and repeating his argument that they are working for \"real political revolution.\"\nHe tells the cheering crowd, \"If we work hard, I believe we're going to win Iowa.\"\nAsked about the debate Sanders says, \"I think it went great.\"\n___\n10 p.m.\nAnd the second debate of the Democratic campaign for president has come to an end with closing statements.\nMartin O'Malley is pitching himself as a new leader, asking voters to discard the \"divisive ideologies of our past\" and \"polarizing figures from our past.\"\nThe former Maryland governor says he can create an economy that works for all and identify foreign threats before they \"back us into military corners.\"\nHillary Rodham Clinton turns attention back to economic issues in her closing statement.\nShe says that, \"ultimately, I think the president's job is to do everything possible, everything that she can do, to lift up the people of the country.\"\nSanders closes the debate by again calling for a \"political revolution,\" saying it is unacceptable for the U.S. to have a \"corrupt\" campaign finance system, no universal health care, high childhood poverty and no guaranteed paid family medical leave.\nHe says, \"That's not the America that I think we should be.\"\n___\n9:51 p.m.\nAsked about his greatest test, Bernie Sanders cites his work on veterans' health care in the wake of the Veterans Administration scandal \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and not getting everything he wanted in his reform bill.\nSanders is the co-author of a veterans' health care reform bill with GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona.\nThe legislation has been widely praised, but Sanders says it's far from the bill he initially penned. Sanders says he was forced to go back to the drawing board after his initial legislation didn't receive enough votes.\nThat moment, he says, represented a challenge he overcame.\n___\n9:49 p.m.\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley is pointing to no single crisis during his tenure as comparing to those that a president would face.\nHis reason? Because he says there is no test is like what he would face as president.\nO'Malley says: \"I can tell you that as a mayor and as a governor that I learned many disciplines. ... I've been tried over many emergencies.\"\n___\n9:48 p.m.\nThe Democratic candidates for president are answering a question about their greatest test and how it would prepare them for the rigors of serving in the White House.\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton points to the deliberations over killing Osama bin Laden.\nClinton says being \"part of a very small group\" advising President Barack Obama on the matter \"really did give me an insight into the very difficult problems presidents face.\"\nShe says she advocated pursuing the assassination mission, despite intelligence she says \"was by no means absolute.\"\nClinton adds that \"there was no one to talk to\" outside the circle of advisers who had access to the intelligence and discussions. That includes her husband, former President Bill Clinton.\n___\n9:45 p.m.\nBernie Sanders says single-payer health insurance is the only way to go. But Hillary Rodham Clinton argues that she once thought this would happen and that \"revolution never came.\"\nThe Vermont senator and former secretary of state are clashing over health care in the second Democratic debate.\nSanders says changing to a single-payer system would take time but that it can happen \"when millions of people stand up and agree to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies.\"\nClinton retorts that Sanders' plans would put too much power in the hands of the states.\nShe adds at the debate in Des Moines that \"if I lived in Iowa, I would not want Terry Branstad administering my health care.\"\nBranstad is the Republican governor of Iowa.\n___\n9: 40 p.m.\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley is making an impassioned case for debt-free college and railing against high interest rates for federal student loans.\nO'Malley often cites his own daughter's college debt when he talks about lowering college costs.\nHe says he is proud of his daughters going to college and adds, \"but we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our natural lives. It doesn't need to be that way.\"\nHe says, \"It doesn't need to be that way.\"\nO'Malley's debt-free college plan centers in part on getting states to contribute more to public colleges and universities.\n___\n9:35 p.m.\nHillary Rodham Clinton is turning a discussion about her emails into a broad-ranging attack on Republicans.\nShe says, \"I do think it's important to do exactly what Sen. Sanders said, and that is to start talking about the issues that the American people really care about.\"\nShe says that there are \"differences among us\" on the Democratic debate stage. But, she adds, \"they pale compared to what's happening on the Republican side.\"\nClinton then puts forth a list of what she calls \"alarming plans.\"\nShe says, \"All of us support funding Planned Parenthood. All of us believe climate change is real. All of us want equal pay for equal work. They don't believe in any of that. So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about.\"\n___\n9:30 p.m.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders still doesn't care about Hillary Rodham Clinton's emails.\nSanders suggested in a recent interview that the investigation into Clinton's use of a private email account and server while serving as secretary of state had merit.\nBut asked about that interview at the second Democratic debate, he jabs the media.\nSanders says, \"That's just media stuff. I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email. I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email.\"\nSanders says it's time to move on, and Clinton seizes the opening to add, \"I couldn't agree more.\"\nAsked if she can promise the country that another shoe won't drop in the email story, she points to her recent testimony before Congress when she was questioned about the issue.\nShe says, \"I think after 11 hours, that's pretty clear.\"\n___\n9:25 p.m.\nBernie Sanders say the \"political revolution\" he's trying to create can overpower a GOP-led Congress that he argues is beholden to big-money interests.\nAnd he's downplaying the idea that Congress doesn't always listen to what the majority of Americans want.\nHe says most Americans want to improve infrastructure and raise the minimum wage. He claims that if people \"stand up and fight back\" they can take on corporate lobbyists and change the tone in Washington.\nHe says, \"Enough is enough. This government belongs to us, not just the billionaires.\"\n___\n9:20 p.m.\nWhile the Democratic candidates agree on many issues, Martin O'Malley is stressing their differences on guns.\nDuring the second Democratic debate, the former Maryland governor is highlighting his record in passing gun safety legislation.\nHe questions Sanders' support for a 2005 measure to give gun manufacturers immunity from lawsuits. O'Malley also says that rival Hillary Rodham Clinton has been on \"three sides of this issue.\"\nHe says, \"When you ran in 2000, you said we needed federal robust regulation, then in 2008 you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying we don't need those regulations ... and now you've come back around here.\"\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders chimes in to note that Baltimore \"is not now one of the safest cities in America.\"\nO'Malley is the former mayor of Baltimore, which recorded its 300th homicide of the year on Saturday.\n___\n9:10 p.m.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders says the business model of Wall Street is \"fraud.\"\nHe pledges that no one from Wall Street will advise him on economic policy if he's elected president.\nSanders is challenging Hillary Rodham Clinton on her ties to Wall Street as he promises to aggressively take on and break up the nation's largest banks.\nHe says Wall Street has dominated Republican and Democratic presidential administrations.\nHe is chiding Clinton for suggesting that Wall Street bankers will play by the rules. He says the big banks operate through \"greed and fraud.\"\nHe says, \"Who are we kidding? The business model of Wall Street is fraud, that's what it is.\"\n___\n9:05 p.m.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is saying at the second Democratic debate that Hillary Rodham Clinton is beholden to Wall Street financial institutions and will not act strongly enough to regulate them.\nOf the plan Clinton is offering to regulate the nation's financial industry, Sanders says simply: \"Not good enough.\"\nHe continues: \"Let's not be naive about it. Why over her political career has Wall Street been the major contributor to her campaign?\"\nClinton replies sharply that as a senator from New York, she stood in Manhattan to help rebuild the financial heart of the nation after Sept. 11.\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley jumps in to call Clinton's plans \"weak tea.\"\nO'Malley says you can't be the candidate for Main Street by being \"the candidate for Wall Street.\"\n___\n9 p.m.\nHillary Rodham Clinton is deviating from her Democratic primary rivals on minimum wage.\nClinton says the federal wage floor should be raised to $12 per hour from the current $7.25. She says $15 is too high.\nThat's the wage sought by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley.\nClinton says she respects the concerns of economists and business leaders who argue such an immediate hike would lead to job losses and other negative consequences.\nSanders says he will \"apologize to no one\" for backing the $15 wage. He says that several U.S. cities already have gone to the higher level without suffering any catastrophic results.\nBoth Sanders and O'Malley argue that higher wages benefit the overall economy, because workers have more money to spend as consumers.\nO'Malley says, \"We should stop taking our advice from economists on Wall Street.\"\n___\n8:55 p.m.\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley says the United States must focus on immigration reform, rather than more border security.\nDuring the second Democratic debate, O'Malley says that that net immigration from Mexico last year was zero.\nHe says: \"Fact check me. Go ahead. Check it out.\"\nO'Malley argues that the real focus should be on providing a pathway to citizenship for those in the country illegally.\n___\n8:45 p.m.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders says he wants public college tuition to be free for all Americans and will pay for it by raising taxes, but he won't say by how much.\nSanders says, \"There must be a tax on Wall Street speculation. ... It's their turn to bail out the middle class.\"\nBut when asked specifically by how much he'll raise taxes, Sanders replies that \"we haven't come up with an exact number yet, but it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90 percent.\"\nHe zings, \"I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower.\"\nSander is a longtime independent who often calls himself a democratic socialist.\n___\n8:40 p.m.\nThe Democratic presidential debate has shifted away from foreign policy and is now focused on domestic issues.\nAnd the three Democratic candidates say they agree that wealthy citizens and corporations should pay more in taxes to benefit the middle class.\nAll say they support reducing the costs of college and paid family leave. Hillary Rodham Clinton says she'll close loopholes and eliminate deductions that benefit big corporations.\nShe says, \"I've made very clear hardworking, middle-class families need a raise, not a tax increase.\"\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley says he's the only one with a record of keeping college costs low.\nDuring his tenure as governor, Maryland's university system froze tuition for four years. He says wealthier Americans should be willing to contribute more for the benefit of everyone.\n___\n8:35 p.m.\nIn the wake of the Paris attacks, French President Francois Hollande vows that his nation will wage \"merciless\" war on the Islamic State.\nAt the Democratic debate, Hillary Rodham Clinton is deflecting a question of whether she would declare war on the militant group.\nThe former secretary says the United States has to beef up its intelligence capabilities. She says, \"It is difficult finding intelligence that is actionable, but we have to keep on trying. ... There's a lot of work we need to keep doing.\"\nHer rival Bernie Sanders interrupts, suggesting that too little of the existing U.S. military budget of $600 billion is used to fight \"international terrorism.\"\nInstead, Sanders complains that too much is spent to maintain nuclear weapons that he sees as part of the U.S. military strategy of the last century.\n___\n8:32 p.m.\nThe Republican candidates for president are jumping on the refusal of the Democratic candidates to say the words \"radical Islam\" at their debate.\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush tweets, \"Yes, we are at war with radical Islamic terrorism.\"\nRick Santorum adds on Twitter, \"@HillaryClinton how can we defeat our enemy if we cannot identify who they are and what motivates them?\"\nSays Carly Fiorina on Twitter: \"Hillary Clinton will not call this Islamic terrorism. I will.\"\n___\n8:30 p.m.\nAll three Democratic presidential candidates are declining to use the term \"radical Islam\" at the party's second debate, a description used by many of their Republican rivals.\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton says, \"I don't think we are at war with Islam. ... I think we're at war with jihadists.\"\nShe adds that \"it's not particularly helpful\" to use language that alienates many Muslims, and she notes that Republican President George W. Bush made a similar point after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders says, \"I don't think the term is important.\" He says the more important issue is the \"entire world coming together\" to defeat militants.\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley says using the term \"radical Islam\" is unnecessarily offensive to Muslims in America. He says he prefers \"radical jihadists\" and describes them as a group that is \"perverting the name of a major world religion.\"\n___\n8:25 p.m.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders says countries in the Middle East must get more involved in the fight against the Islamic State.\nDuring a foreign policy discussion during the second Democratic debate, Sanders calls the current conflict a \"war for the soul of Islam.\"\nHe says that other Muslim countries in the region will need to get \"deeply involved\" and lead the effort. He mentions Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey and Jordan by name.\nHillary Rodham Clinton calls the comment \"unfair\" to some counties, in particular Jordan. She says Jordan has \"put a lot on the line\" for the United States.\nBut Clinton says she agrees that Turkey and the Gulf nations should decide if they will stand with the United States against \"this kind of jihadi radicalism.\"\n___\n8:20 p.m.\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley says simply toppling dictators is not a suitable foreign policy for the 21st century, referring to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.\nO'Malley is attempting to draw a contrast with former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on foreign policy during the second Democratic debate.\nHe says Syria, Libya and Afghanistan are \"a mess\" and that the United States isn't doing enough to build stable democracies after toppling dictators.\nHe says the United States needs better \"human intelligence\" on the ground to understand what actors will step up to fill the void after dictators fall.\n___\n8:17 p.m.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is criticizing former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's vote as a New York senator for the resolution to allow the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nSanders says, \"I don't think any sensible person\" would have supported the use-of-force resolution.\nHe calls the invasion \"the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of the United States.\"\nClinton has said the 2002 vote was a mistake, but says there were acts leading up to the invasion that suggested Islamic extremists had struck at U.S. installations.\n___\n8:15 p.m.\nHillary Rodham Clinton is defending the Obama administration's initial approach to the rise of Islamic State, including her actions as secretary of state.\nClinton rejects the notion that she underestimated the militants, and she blames their rise on leaders in the Middle East and names former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.\nClinton says al-Maliki did not do enough to maintain stability in Iraq once the U.S. turned over control of the nation.\nShe adds that she did advocate that the U.S. do more to \"train and equip moderates\" in Syria, which has since fallen into civil war.\n___\n8:10 p.m.\nA look at the opening statements from the second presidential Democratic debate.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders begins with sharp language for the Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for the attack in Paris.\nHe says, \"Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of this barbarous organization.\"\nBut Sanders also pivots from the attacks to the economic issues that are the focus of his campaign.\nFront-runner and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton keeps to the attacks in her statement, saying \"our prayers are with the people of France tonight.\"\nShe adds: \"But that is not enough. We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical, Jihadist ideology that motivates organizations ISIS.\"\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley touts his executive experience in his opening remarks, and says the U.S. needs \"new thinking\" and \"new leadership\" to respond to threats like those posed by the Islamic State.\n___\n8 p.m.\nThe second debate of the Democratic campaign for president is underway, and it's starting with a moment of silence for the victims of the attacks in Paris.\nA coordinated gun-and-suicide bombing attack tore across Paris on Friday, leaving at least 129 people dead and 352 injured. It marked the deadliest violence on French soil since World War II.\nFrench President Francois Hollande has vowed that his country will wage \"merciless\" war on the Islamic State group, which claimed responsibility for the carnage.\nThe candidates will each make an opening statement before the debate's first section focuses on the attacks and foreign policy.\n___\n7:45 p.m.\nThe Democratic candidates for president are gathering for the party's second debate of the 2016 campaign, a meeting that will take place in the shadow of the attacks in Paris.\nThe campaigns have tangled with debate host CBS over the format of the debate in the hours before the debate.\nWhen CBS said on a conference call with the campaigns that it wanted to focus the opening statement and the first section of the debate on the Paris attacks, the campaign of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders vigorously disagreed.\nThat's according to a participant on the call, who spoke on condition of anonymity and was not authorized to speak publicly.\nSanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver says the key issue is a proposal to shorten the opening statements from 90 seconds to 30 seconds in order to move quickly to questions in a debate unfolding a day after the Paris attacks.\nThe Vermont senator's campaign says it successfully argued on behalf of the longer opening statements, which all three candidates will deliver.\nThe debate will begin with a moment of silence in memory of the victims of the attacks.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094 By Ken Thomas.", "byline": "", "description": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 The Democratic presidential candidates are debating for the second time in the 2016 nomination contest, this time in Des Moines.", "title": "The Latest: Democratic 2016 candidates meet for 2nd debate", "url": "http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-11-14-US--DEM%202016-Debate-The%20Latest/id-4e8b31b826674d8abdd6e393d15526bf", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Rick Santorum", "Jeff Weaver", "Martin O'Malley", "Francois Hollande", "Bill Clinton", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "Dwight D.

Bernie Sanders begins with sharp language for the Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for the attack in Paris.\nHe says, \"Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of this barbarous organization.\"\nBut Sanders also pivots from the attacks to the economic issues that are the focus of his campaign.\nFront-runner and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton keeps to the attacks in her statement, saying \"our prayers are with the people of France tonight.\"\nShe adds: \"But that is not enough.

Martin O'Malley touts his executive experience in his opening remarks, and says the U.S. needs \"new thinking\" and \"new leadership\" to respond to threats like those posed by the Islamic State.\n___\n8 p.m.\nThe second debate of the Democratic campaign for president is underway, and it's starting with a moment of silence for the victims of the attacks in Paris.\nA coordinated gun-and-suicide bombing attack tore across Paris on Friday, leaving at least 129 people dead and 352 injured. It marked the deadliest violence on French soil since World War II.\nFrench President Francois Hollande has vowed that his country will wage \"merciless\" war on the Islamic State group, which claimed responsibility for the carnage.\nThe candidates will each make an opening statement before the debate's first section focuses on the attacks and foreign policy.\n___\n7:45 p.m.\nThe Democratic candidates for president are gathering for the party's second debate of the 2016 campaign, a meeting that will take place in the shadow of the attacks in Paris.\nThe campaigns have tangled with debate host CBS over the format of the debate in the hours before the debate.\nWhen CBS said on a conference call with the campaigns that it wanted to focus the opening statement and the first section of the debate on the Paris attacks, the campaign of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders vigorously disagreed.\nThat's according to a participant on the call, who spoke on condition of anonymity and was not authorized to speak publicly.\nSanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver says the key issue is a proposal to shorten the opening statements from 90 seconds to 30 seconds in order to move quickly to questions in a debate unfolding a day after the Paris attacks.\nThe Vermont senator's campaign says it successfully argued on behalf of the longer opening statements, which all three candidates will deliver.\nThe debate will begin with a moment of silence in memory of the victims of the attacks.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094 By Ken Thomas.", "byline": "", "description": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 The Democratic presidential candidates are debating for the second time in the 2016 nomination contest, this time in Des Moines.", "title": "The Latest: Democratic 2016 candidates meet for 2nd debate", "url": "http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2015-11-14-US--DEM%202016-Debate-The%20Latest/id-c207d2f4dca145cd98e4b8cca2bedfe2", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Rick Santorum", "Jeff Weaver", "Martin O'Malley", "Francois Hollande", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "Dwight D.

Sanders envisions a \"single-payer\" system that would be run by the states under federal rules.\nEven as the field responded somberly to the deadly attacks in Paris, the debate Saturday night marked a feistier phase in the Democratic campaign. Helped by a strong autumn, Clinton has built a small lead in Iowa and is trying to stave off Sanders in the Feb. 1 presidential caucuses.\nSanders put Clinton on the defensive in the debate when he said Wall Street had been the major contributor to her campaigns in order to get support in return.\nClinton responded that Sanders was trying to \"impugn my integrity\" and said that as a New York senator, she helped New York City's financial hub rebuild after the Sept. 11 attacks. Her invoking of 9/11 received an incredulous response on social media and Republicans accused her of shamefully hiding behind the attacks to deflect attention from her ties to her wealthiest donors.\nTaking the stage in Ames, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley said Clinton brought up 9/11 to try to \"mask her proximity to Wall Street and the huge amount of contributions and the dollars she has received personally from the major banks of Wall Street.\"\n\"She doesn't have to mask it. It is what it is,\" O'Malley said. \"That is the sort of company, that is the sort economic advice that she would follow.\"\nSanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said following the debate that the senator's proposals would be paid for with higher taxes on the wealthy and large corporations. \"He's raising taxes to pay for relief for middle-income and working people,\" he said.\nHe also said Sanders would build upon the health care law to provide universal coverage. \"It's not a question of ripping up Obamacare, it's really expanding on the promise of Obamacare,\" Weaver said.\nThe barbecue inside a massive agriculture center featured another appearance by Bill Clinton, who briefly introduced his wife and joked that after watching the debates, \"I think I'm going to vote for Hillary.\"\n___\nOn Twitter, follow Ken Thomas: https://twitter.com/KThomasDC", "byline": "", "description": "AMES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Fresh from the second Democratic presidential debate, Hillary Rodham Clinton suggested Sunday that Bernie Sanders would raise middle-class taxes and \"scrap\" President Barack Obama's health care law, in an escalating critique of the Vermont senator.", "title": "Clinton goes after Sanders on taxes, health care", "url": "http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-11-15-US--DEM%202016-Clinton/id-e642156bd9b549fb8161c27ced2fad72", "topics": ["health"], "people": ["Jeff Weaver", "Martin O'Malley", "Bill Clinton", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Barack Obama", "Ken Thomas", "Bernie Sanders", "Terry Branstad"], "orgs": ["AMES"], "election_confidence": 0.535904016805291, "authors": [{"author_id": 39392, "fullname": "ken thomas", "primary_org": "ap"}], "date_written": "2015-11-15 16:27:00", "org": "ap", "article_id": "339e5cfe47434f9efe0d01fa28b3f86f", "date_access": "2015-11-15 22:00:05.671043"},

Martin O'Malley.\nClinton says she respects the concerns of economists and business leaders who argue such an immediate hike would lead to job losses and other negative consequences.\nSanders says he will \"apologize to no one\" for backing the $15 wage. He says that several U.S. cities already have gone to the higher level without suffering any catastrophic results.\nBoth Sanders and O'Malley argue that higher wages benefit the overall economy, because workers have more money to spend as consumers.\nO'Malley says, \"We should stop taking our advice from economists on Wall Street.\"\n___\n8:55 p.m.\nFormer Maryland Gov.

He mentions Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey and Jordan by name.\nHillary Rodham Clinton calls the comment \"unfair\" to some counties, in particular Jordan. She says Jordan has \"put a lot on the line\" for the United States.\nBut Clinton says she agrees that Turkey and the Gulf nations should decide if they will stand with the United States against \"this kind of jihadi radicalism.\"\n___\n8:20 p.m.\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley says simply toppling dictators is not a suitable foreign policy for the 21st century, referring to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.\nO'Malley is attempting to draw a contrast with former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on foreign policy during the second Democratic debate.\nHe says Syria, Libya and Afghanistan are \"a mess\" and that the United States isn't doing enough to build stable democracies after toppling dictators.\nHe says the United States needs better \"human intelligence\" on the ground to understand what actors will step up to fill the void after dictators fall.\n___\n8:17 p.m.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is criticizing former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's vote as a New York senator for the resolution to allow the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nSanders says, \"I don't think any sensible person\" would have supported the use-of-force resolution.\nHe calls the invasion \"the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of the United States.\"\nClinton has said the 2002 vote was a mistake, but says there were acts leading up to the invasion that suggested Islamic extremists had struck at U.S. installations.\n___\n8:15 p.m.\nHillary Rodham Clinton is defending the Obama administration's initial approach to the rise of Islamic State, including her actions as secretary of state.\nClinton rejects the notion that she underestimated the militants, and she blames their rise on leaders in the Middle East and names former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.\nClinton says al-Maliki did not do enough to maintain stability in Iraq once the U.S. turned over control of the nation.\nShe adds that she did advocate that the U.S. do more to \"train and equip moderates\" in Syria, which has since fallen into civil war.\n___\n8:10 p.m.\nA look at the opening statements from the second presidential Democratic debate.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders begins with sharp language for the Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for the attack in Paris.\nHe says, \"Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of this barbarous organization.\"\nBut Sanders also pivots from the attacks to the economic issues that are the focus of his campaign.\nFront-runner and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton keeps to the attacks in her statement, saying \"our prayers are with the people of France tonight.\"\nShe adds: \"But that is not enough. We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical, Jihadist ideology that motivates organizations ISIS.\"\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley touts his executive experience in his opening remarks, and says the U.S. needs \"new thinking\" and \"new leadership\" to respond to threats like those posed by the Islamic State.\n___\n8 p.m.\nThe second debate of the Democratic campaign for president is underway, and it's starting with a moment of silence for the victims of the attacks in Paris.\nA coordinated gun-and-suicide bombing attack tore across Paris on Friday, leaving at least 129 people dead and 352 injured. It marked the deadliest violence on French soil since World War II.\nFrench President Francois Hollande has vowed that his country will wage \"merciless\" war on the Islamic State group, which claimed responsibility for the carnage.\nThe candidates will each make an opening statement before the debate's first section focuses on the attacks and foreign policy.\n___\n7:45 p.m.\nThe Democratic candidates for president are gathering for the party's second debate of the 2016 campaign, a meeting that will take place in the shadow of the attacks in Paris.\nThe campaigns have tangled with debate host CBS over the format of the debate in the hours before the debate.\nWhen CBS said on a conference call with the campaigns that it wanted to focus the opening statement and the first section of the debate on the Paris attacks, the campaign of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders vigorously disagreed.\nThat's according to a participant on the call, who spoke on condition of anonymity and was not authorized to speak publicly.\nSanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver says the key issue is a proposal to shorten the opening statements from 90 seconds to 30 seconds in order to move quickly to questions in a debate unfolding a day after the Paris attacks.\nThe Vermont senator's campaign says it successfully argued on behalf of the longer opening statements, which all three candidates will deliver.\nThe debate will begin with a moment of silence in memory of the victims of the attacks.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094 By Ken Thomas.", "byline": "", "description": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 The Democratic presidential candidates are debating for the second time in the 2016 nomination contest, this time in Des Moines.", "title": "The Latest: Democratic 2016 candidates meet for 2nd debate", "url": "http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-11-14-US--DEM%202016-Debate-The%20Latest/id-00b83abf277141dca5ccd792cdba0296", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Rick Santorum", "Jeff Weaver", "Martin O'Malley", "Francois Hollande", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "Dwight D.

He said that U.S. invasion \"unraveled the region.\"\nClinton fought back, saying terrorism has been erupting for decades, specifically mentioning the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. She said the recent unrest in Libya and other parts of the Middle East was symptomatic of an \"arc of instability from North Africa to Afghanistan.\"\nShe rejected the idea that she and the rest of the administration underestimated the growing threat of the Islamic State.\nThe early dispute revealed a foreign policy split within the Democratic Party, with Sanders playing to the anti-war activists who boosted then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama to victory in 2008.\nSanders argued for a far more hands-off approach, advocating for Muslim countries to lead the fight and arguing that the war against Islamic State militants is about the \"soul of Islam.\"\nClinton has a history of advocating for more robust involvement across the globe \u00e2\u0080\u0094 both as a presidential candidate eight years ago and as Barack Obama's secretary of state. In recent weeks, she has advocated for a more aggressive U.S. role in the Syrian conflict, calling for a no-fly zone over the area, a move the Obama administration opposes.\nThe candidates were meeting in the shadow of the Paris attacks that killed at least 129 and wounded at least 352 people.\nThe debate began with a solemn tone, with a moment of silence followed by previously unplanned foreign policy questions.\nAll the candidates denounced the attacks, the first time the Democratic field spoke about the incidents.\nThe Republican presidential candidates condemned the Paris attacks earlier in the day, coupled with sharp criticism for Obama and his former secretary of state, Clinton.\nFormer technology executive Carly Fiorina said she was angry that Obama and Clinton declared victory in Iraq and \"abandoned all of our hard-won gains for political expediency.\" Donald Trump, the celebrity businessman who leads many GOP polls, said the U.S. should be far more aggressive against the Islamic State and would be \"insane\" to accept any refugees from Syria.\nForeign relations is an area where Clinton, as a former secretary of state, is in the strongest position to talk about the attacks and the U.S. effort to dismantle the Islamic State group. But she is vulnerable, too, her tenure tied to that of Obama, who's struggled to contain the threat from Islamic militants in Syria and associated terror attacks across the globe.\nSince the party's first debate a month ago, Clinton has helped build a lead in the early voting states, an uptick that has come amid other signs the party is coalescing behind her.

{"body": " (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The Democratic presidential candidates are debating for the second time in the 2016 nomination contest, this time in Des Moines.\nThe latest developments (all times local):\n___\n8:32 p.m.\nThe Republican candidates for president are jumping on the refusal of the Democratic candidates to say the words \"radical Islam\" at their debate.\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush tweets, \"Yes, we are at war with radical Islamic terrorism.\"\nRick Santorum adds on Twitter, \"@HillaryClinton how can we defeat our enemy if we cannot identify who they are and what motivates them?\"\n___\n8:30 p.m.\nAll three Democratic presidential candidates are declining to use the term \"radical Islam\" at the party's second debate, a description used by many of their Republican rivals.\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton says, \"I don't think we are at war with Islam. ... I think we're at war with jihadists.\"\nShe adds that \"it's not particularly helpful\" to use language that alienates many Muslims, and she notes that Republican President George W. Bush made a similar point after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders says, \"I don't think the term is important.\" He says the more important issue is the \"entire world coming together\" to defeat militants.\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley says using the term \"radical Islam\" is unnecessarily offensive to Muslims in America. He says he prefers \"radical jihadists\" and describes them as a group that is \"perverting the name of a major world religion.\"\n___\n8:25 p.m.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders says countries in the Middle East must get more involved in the fight against the Islamic State.\nDuring a foreign policy discussion during the second Democratic debate, Sanders calls the current conflict a \"war for the soul of Islam.\"\nHe says that other Muslim countries in the region will need to get \"deeply involved\" and lead the effort. He mentions Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey and Jordan by name.\nHillary Rodham Clinton calls the comment \"unfair\" to some counties, in particular Jordan. She says Jordan has \"put a lot on the line\" for the United States.\nBut Clinton says she agrees that Turkey and the Gulf nations should decide if they will stand with the United States against \"this kind of jihadi radicalism.\"\n___\n8:20 p.m.\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley says simply toppling dictators is not a suitable foreign policy for the 21st century, referring to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.\nO'Malley is attempting to draw a contrast with former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on foreign policy during the second Democratic debate.\nHe says Syria, Libya and Afghanistan are \"a mess\" and that the United States isn't doing enough to build stable democracies after toppling dictators.\nHe says the United States needs better \"human intelligence\" on the ground to understand what actors will step up to fill the void after dictators fall.\n___\n8:17 p.m.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is criticizing former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's vote as a New York senator for the resolution to allow the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nSanders says, \"I don't think any sensible person\" would have supported the use-of-force resolution.\nHe calls the invasion \"the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of the United States.\"\nClinton has said the 2002 vote was a mistake, but says there were acts leading up to the invasion that suggested Islamic extremists had struck at U.S. installations.\n___\n8:15 p.m.\nHillary Rodham Clinton is defending the Obama administration's initial approach to the rise of Islamic State, including her actions as secretary of state.\nClinton rejects the notion that she underestimated the militants, and she blames their rise on leaders in the Middle East and names former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.\nClinton says al-Maliki did not do enough to maintain stability in Iraq once the U.S. turned over control of the nation.\nShe adds that she did advocate that the U.S. do more to \"train and equip moderates\" in Syria, which has since fallen into civil war.\n___\n8:10 p.m.\nA look at the opening statements from the second presidential Democratic debate.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders begins with sharp language for the Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for the attack in Paris.\nHe says, \"Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of this barbarous organization.\"\nBut Sanders also pivots from the attacks to the economic issues that are the focus of his campaign.\nFront-runner and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton keeps to the attacks in her statement, saying \"our prayers are with the people of France tonight.\"\nShe adds: \"But that is not enough. We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical, Jihadist ideology that motivates organizations ISIS.\"\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley touts his executive experience in his opening remarks, and says the U.S. needs \"new thinking\" and \"new leadership\" to respond to threats like those posed by the Islamic State.\n___\n8 p.m.\nThe second debate of the Democratic campaign for president is underway, and it's starting with a moment of silence for the victims of the attacks in Paris.\nA coordinated gun-and-suicide bombing attack tore across Paris on Friday, leaving at least 129 people dead and 352 injured. It marked the deadliest violence on French soil since World War II.\nFrench President Francois Hollande has vowed that his country will wage \"merciless\" war on the Islamic State group, which claimed responsibility for the carnage.\nThe candidates will each make an opening statement before the debate's first section focuses on the attacks and foreign policy.\n___\n7:45 p.m.\nThe Democratic candidates for president are gathering for the party's second debate of the 2016 campaign, a meeting that will take place in the shadow of the attacks in Paris.\nThe campaigns have tangled with debate host CBS over the format of the debate in the hours before the debate.\nWhen CBS said on a conference call with the campaigns that it wanted to focus the opening statement and the first section of the debate on the Paris attacks, the campaign of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders vigorously disagreed.\nThat's according to a participant on the call, who spoke on condition of anonymity and was not authorized to speak publicly.\nSanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver says the key issue is a proposal to shorten the opening statements from 90 seconds to 30 seconds in order to move quickly to questions in a debate unfolding a day after the Paris attacks.\nThe Vermont senator's campaign says it successfully argued on behalf of the longer opening statements, which all three candidates will deliver.\nThe debate will begin with a moment of silence in memory of the victims of the attacks.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094 By Ken Thomas.", "byline": "", "description": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 The Democratic presidential candidates are debating for the second time in the 2016 nomination contest, this time in Des Moines.", "title": "The Latest: Democratic 2016 candidates meet for 2nd debate", "url": "http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-11-14-US-DEM-2016-Debate-The-Latest/id-d9be7b6490fd46ddb01521463c80ddce", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Rick Santorum", "Jeff Weaver", "Martin O'Malley", "Francois Hollande", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "George W.

{"body": " (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The bloody attacks in Paris are putting the Syrian refugee crisis at center stage in U.S. politics as migrants from that war-torn country surge toward the West and security concerns rise.\nGOP presidential contender Marco Rubio on Sunday said the United States should no longer accept Syrian refugees because it's impossible to know whether they have links to Islamic militants \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an apparent shift from earlier statements in which he left open the prospects of migrants being admitted with proper vetting.\n\"It's not that we don't want to, it's that we can't,\" Rubio said Sunday on ABC's \"This Week.\"  \"Because there's no way to background check someone that's coming from Syria.  Who do you call and do a background check on them?\"\nThe question of admitting Syrian refugees has for months been part of the national security discussion among 2016 candidates that cuts to the heart of the American identity as a refuge. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush on Sunday told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that the U.S. should admit Syrian Christians, after proper vetting. Other Republican candidates have called for a ban on allowing Syrians into the U.S. All three Democratic presidential candidates have said they would admit Syrians but only after thorough background checks.\nBut Friday night's mass killings in Paris, which left at least 129 people dead, offered evidence that may have backed up what many, including Rubio, had been warning: People with secret ties to Islamic militants could flow across borders as part of waves of refugees.\nAuthorities said a Syrian passport found near one of the Paris attackers that had been registered last month and traveled through three countries along a busy migrant corridor known for lax controls. It was not clear whether the document was real or forged. Officials on Sunday were still trying to identify people involved in the conspiracy. They said as many as three of the seven suicide bombers who died in the attacks were French citizens.\nA spokesman for President Barack Obama said Sunday that the administration is moving forward with its plan to thoroughly vet and admit as many as 10,000 Syrian refugees.\n\"What we need to be able to do frankly is sort out that foreign fighter flow, those who have gone into Syria and come out and want to launch attacks or those people who have connections with ISIL in Syria,\"  Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said on Fox News Sunday. \"At the same time, we have to recognize there's tragic victims of this conflict, there are women, and children, orphans of this war and I think we need to do our part, along with our allies, to provide them a safe haven.\"\nThe Paris attacks have elevated national security in the presidential contest. In Saturday night's Democratic presidential debate, which began with a moment of silence for the Paris victims, all three candidates \u00e2\u0080\u0094 former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley \u00e2\u0080\u0094 said the U.S. should admit far more than the 10,000 Syrians to which Obama has committed, but only with proper screening.\nRubio on Sunday said that was impossible.\n\"You can't pick up the phone and call Syria, and that's one of the reasons why I said we won't be able to take more refugees,\" Rubio said on ABC.\nThat is a switch from Rubio's other statements this fall, in which he voiced skepticism about proper vetting but still left the door open to admitting refugees.  In September, he told Boston Herald radio: \"We've always been a country that's been willing to accept people who have been displaced. And I would be open to that if it can do it in a way that allows us to ensure that among them are not infiltrated, people who are part of a terrorist organization.\"\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, meanwhile, said Sunday that the U.S. has a responsibility to \"help with refugees after proper screening.\"\n\"And I think or focus out to be on the Christians who have no place in Syria anymore,\" he added in NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" ''They're being beheaded, they're being executed by both sides.

Democrats have spent months boasting about the substantive tone of their contest, attempting to set up a favorable early contrast with the \"carnival barker\" insults of the crowded Republican primary.\nClinton faced criticism of her national security record, when Sanders traced the current instability in the Middle East to the U.S. Senate's vote \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including Clinton's \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to authorize military action in Iraq in 2002. He said that U.S. invasion \"unraveled the region.\"\nThe former secretary of state fought back, saying terrorism has been erupting for decades, specifically mentioning the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

Barack Obama to victory in 2008.\nSanders argued for a far more hands-off approach, advocating for Muslim countries to lead the fight and declaring that the war against Islamic State militants is about the \"soul of Islam.\"\nClinton has a history of advocating for more robust involvement across the globe \u00e2\u0080\u0094 both as a presidential candidate eight years ago and as Obama's secretary of state. In recent weeks, she has called for a more aggressive U.S. role in the Syrian conflict, including a no-fly zone over the area, a move the Obama administration opposes. But she stood by her opposition to seeking a formal declaration of war against the Islamic State.\nForeign relations is an area where Clinton, as a former secretary of state, is in the strongest position to talk about the attacks and the U.S. effort to dismantle the Islamic State group. But she is vulnerable, too, her tenure tied to that of Obama, who's struggled to contain the threat from Islamic militants in Syria and associated terror attacks across the globe.\nThe candidates were meeting in the shadow of the Paris attacks that killed at least 129 and wounded at least 352 people. The debate began with a solemn tone, with a moment of silence followed by previously unplanned foreign policy questions.\nAll the candidates denounced the attacks, the first time the Democratic field spoke about the incidents.\nThey gave some fodder to their Republican critics, who coupled condemnation of the Paris attacks during the day with sharp criticism for Obama and his former secretary of state, Clinton.\n\"We are at war with violent extremism, we are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression,\" said Clinton, arguing the U.S. is not at war with Islam or all Muslims. \"I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.\"\nSanders and O'Malley agreed with her sentiments, saying the term \"radical Islam\" used by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and other Republican presidential candidates, is unnecessarily offensive to American Muslims.\nRepublicans immediately seized on the remarks. \"Yes, we are at war with radical Islamic terrorism,\" tweeted former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.\nThe conversation later pivoted to economic issues, with the candidates tangling over how to pay for their plans to expand college affordability, family leave and prescription drug coverage. All three agreed that wealthy citizens and corporations should pay more in taxes to benefit the middle class.\n\"I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,\" joked Sanders, saying the former president backed a 90 percent marginal tax rate.\nThe three tangled over how high to increase the minimum wage, with Clinton backing a $12-per-hour federal floor while Sanders and O'Malley said $15 an hour \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the rate being pushed by a campaign of fast-food workers and labor unions.\nWhile Clinton is wary of alienating Sanders backers whose support she'll need should she win the nomination, she drew a contrast with him on gun control. Highlighting a vote he took giving the gun industry immunity from lawsuits, she charged him with failing to push hard enough to regulate ownership.\nSince the party's first debate a month ago, Clinton has built a lead in the early voting states, an uptick that has come amid other signs the party is coalescing behind her. An Associated Press survey of superdelegates published Friday found that half of the Democratic insiders are publicly backing Clinton.\nSanders may have inadvertently facilitated some of her progress in the first debate, when he seemed to dismiss the controversy over her use of a private email account and server by saying Americans are tired of hearing about her \"damn emails.\"\nSaturday night, Sanders declined once again to attack:  \"I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email.

Barack Obama to victory in 2008.\nSanders argued for a far more hands-off approach, advocating for Muslim countries to lead the fight and declaring that the war against Islamic State militants is about the \"soul of Islam.\"\nClinton has a history of advocating for more robust involvement across the globe \u00e2\u0080\u0094 both as a presidential candidate eight years ago and as Obama's secretary of state. In recent weeks, she has called for a more aggressive U.S. role in the Syrian conflict, including a no-fly zone over the area, a move the Obama administration opposes. But she stood by her opposition to seeking a formal declaration of war against the Islamic State.\nAll the candidates denounced the attacks, and the debate began on a solemn note with a moment of silence followed by the previously unplanned foreign policy questions.\nThey gave some fodder to their Republican critics, who coupled condemnation of the Paris attacks during the day with sharp criticism for Obama and his former secretary of state, Clinton.\n\"We are at war with violent extremism, we are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression,\" said Clinton, arguing the U.S. is not at war with Islam or all Muslims. \"I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.\"\nSanders and O'Malley agreed with her sentiments, saying the term \"radical Islam\" used by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and other Republican presidential candidates, is unnecessarily offensive to American Muslims.\nRepublicans immediately seized on the remarks. \"Yes, we are at war with radical Islamic terrorism,\" tweeted former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.\nThe conversation later pivoted to economic issues, with the candidates tangling over how to pay for their plans to expand college affordability, family leave and prescription drug coverage.\nThe conversation revealed how Sanders' message has helped shift the party to the left on some economic issues.\nAll three agreed that wealthy citizens and corporations should pay more in taxes to benefit the middle class. They tangled over how high to increase the minimum wage, with Clinton backing a $12-per-hour federal floor while Sanders and O'Malley said $15 an hour \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the rate being pushed by a campaign of fast-food workers and labor unions. And they fought over the degree to which they would curtail large financial institutions, with Sanders describing Wall Street's business model as \"greed and fraud\" \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a startling judgment for a major presidential candidate.\n\"I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,\" joked Sanders, saying the former president backed a 90 percent marginal tax rate.\nWhile Clinton is wary of alienating Sanders backers whose support she'll need should she win the nomination, she did take a few shots. She attempted to cast some of Sanders major proposals, including a single payer health care system and free college, as politically unrealistic.\n\"The revolution never came,\" she said, in a knock on his call for a \"political revolution.\" ''I waited and I got the scars to show for it.\"\nSanders may have inadvertently helped her in the first debate, when he seemed to dismiss the controversy over her use of a private email account and server by saying Americans are tired of hearing about her \"damn emails.\"\nSaturday night, Sanders declined once again to attack:  \"I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email,\" he said.\n\"I agree completely,\" said Clinton, with a laugh.\n___\nLisa Lerer reported from Washington.

{"body": "", "byline": "", "description": "\nCharlie Neibergall / AP\nDES MOINES, Iowa \u2014 Bernie Sanders went after her on the Iraq War, on her Wall Street policy and her corporate donors. Martin O\u2019Malley joined in when he could get the airtime, drawing contrasts on gun control, the Middle East, and Glass-Steagall.All night at the second Democratic debate, Hillary Clinton was a target. But in a brief exchange here at Drake University, the Democratic frontrunner volunteered her own major policy critique \u2014 casting a Sanders health care plan as an effort dismantle the Affordable Care Act and place legislative control in the hands of states run by Republican governors.Clinton, responding to a question about a single-payer health care, brought up a 2013 bill, sponsored by Sanders, that would replace President Obama\u2019s health program, as well as private health insurance and other programs, in favor of a universal benefits and coverage system.\u201cI've looked at the legislation that Sen. Sanders has proposed,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd basically, he does eliminate the Affordable Care Act, eliminate private insurance, eliminates Medicare, eliminates Medicaid, Tri-care, children's health insurance program \u2014 puts it all together in a big program, which he then hands over to the state to administer.\u201dSanders has advocated for a universal health care system this year, but has yet to detail a proposal specific to his presidential campaign. Clinton\u2019s comments on Saturday night \u2014 among the most critical she has made of any Democratic opponent this year \u2014 referred specifically to the senator\u2019s American Health and Security Act.Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton\u2019s communications director, said after the debate that the proposal should worry Democratic voters who worked in support of Obama\u2019s sweeping legislation.\u201cIt\u2019s something that she\u2019s obviously really concerned about,\u201d Palmieri said of Clinton. \u201cThey\u2019re tearing down Affordable Care Act and bringing the country into another big health care debate. That\u2019s not a great way to make progress.\u201dSanders\u2019s plan, Clinton told voters here, would turn health care over to Republican governors like Iowa\u2019s Terry Branstad. (The bill does includes a provision ensuring that, in the absence of a state plan, the federal government would implement one.)\u201cI have to tell you, I would not want, if I lived in Iowa, Terry Branstad administering my health care,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI think as Democrats, we ought to proudly support the Affordable Care Act, improve it, and make it the model that we know it can be.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not as if the ACA doesn\u2019t need to be improved,\u201d Palmieri added afterward. \u201cIt does. But don\u2019t tear it down and then let it up in the state\u2019s control.\u201dGiven the chance to respond during the debate, Sanders said the Affordable Care Act already grants Republican governors state control. His administration, he said, would make health care a citizen-wide right. \u201cWe don't eliminate Medicare. We expand Medicare to all people,\u201d said Sanders.Later on Saturday night, his campaign aides acknowledged the issue as a substantive difference between the two candidates. But they also suggested that Clinton had been unfair to suggest that his proposals would give more control to Republicans.Plus, his campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, argued that support for Sanders, a longtime Independent, would help usher in more Democratic leadership.\u201cRepublican governors are a problem everywhere. They\u2019re a problem with Obamacare,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cYou know how we deal with that problem? We nominate Bernie Sanders to be president of the United States. We bring out millions of young people, working-class people in the political process, and we sweep those people out of office.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be anymore a problem than it is under Obamacare,\u201d said Weaver.\n", "title": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s New Hit On Sanders: Health Care", "url": "http://www.buzzfeed.com/rubycramer/hillary-clintons-new-hit-on-sanders-health-care", "topics": ["health"], "people": ["Charlie Neibergall", "Jeff Weaver", "Martin O'Malley", "Hillary Clinton", "Jennifer Palmieri", "Bernie Sanders", "Terry Branstad"], "orgs": ["Health Care", "United States.", "ACA", "DES MOINES"], "election_confidence": 0.9222439747599511, "authors": [{"author_id": 6688, "fullname": "ruby cramer", "primary_org": "buzzfeed"}], "date_written": "2015-11-15 08:43:52", "org": "buzzfeed", "article_id": "06ddc2abd0dddae30c45930cf4896fe3", "date_access": "2015-11-15 10:08:31.051588"},

Until now,\u201d Grewal\u2019s tweet read.When one of the debate\u2019s moderators, CBS News\u2019s Nancy Cordes, read the tweet aloud, Clinton did not push back on the characterization. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that whoever tweeted that had that impression, because I worked closely with New Yorkers after 9/11 for my entire first term to rebuild,\u201d Clinton said.Clinton\u2019s communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, said that Grewal, the Twitter user, had mischaracterized the remark.\u201cThis is not in response to donations,\u201d Palmieri said. \u201cThat is what the person on Twitter did.\u201dThe point, she told reporters after the debate, was that Clinton\u2019s work as a senator in New York wouldn\u2019t make her less likely to pursue Wall Street legislation: \u201cShe was senator of New York during 9/11, and I think she was proud to help that industry recover,\u201d said Palmieri. \u201cBut when she disagreed with them in 2007, as she did, about the direction the industry was going in, she never afraid to stand up and say she disagreed with them.\u201d\u201cIt was the person on Twitter who connected it to donations. That is not what she did,\u201d she said.The exchange, among several forceful back-and-forths aimed at Clinton, began with a question from Sanders: \u201cWhy, over her political career has Wall Street been a major \u2014 the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou know, maybe they\u2019re dumb and they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to get, but I don\u2019t think so.\u201dClinton pushed back: the majority of her campaign donors make small contributions, she said, and 60% are women. \u201cSo,\u201d she said, \u201cI represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked. Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is.\u201d\u201cI did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat was good for New York. It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.\u201dPalmieri noted that in 2007, Clinton warned of the mortgage practices that led to the recession. This fall, Clinton also outlined a Wall Street plan that would tax high-frequency trading, close a loophole in the \u201cVolcker rule,\u201d and regular risk across banks and hedge funds.\u201cObviously she\u2019s got a plan now that a lot of people on Wall Street don\u2019t like,\u201d Palmieri said.\nLINK: Hillary Clinton Invokes 9/11 In Defense Of Wall Street Contributions\n\n", "title": "Clinton Campaign Pins 9/11 Remark Response On Twitter User", "url": "http://www.buzzfeed.com/rubycramer/clinton-campaign-pins-911-remark-on-twitter-user", "topics": ["economy"], "people": ["Bernie Sanders", "Jennifer Palmieri", "Hillary Clinton", "Mandel Ngan", "Nancy Cordes"], "orgs": ["DES MOINES"], "election_confidence": 0.751130491896289, "authors": [{"author_id": 6688, "fullname": "ruby cramer", "primary_org": "buzzfeed"}], "date_written": "2015-11-15 07:38:18", "org": "buzzfeed", "article_id": "3bb75baf1b2131ea7a0738ce389b50c8", "date_access": "2015-11-15 09:09:13.497825"},

I'm going to be independent. Well, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions? they expect to get something. Everybody knows that.

The candidates themselves still can't explicitly ask for unlimited money, but it's hard to imagine the presence of a candidate \u2014 Democratic or Republican \u2014 with a small group of donors not being beneficial to their super PACs.The combined effect of the deadlocked issues \u2014 which were brought to the FEC by Democratic lawyer Marc Elias, who is also Clinton\u2019s lawyer, on behalf of groups House Majority PAC and Senate Majority PAC \u2014 and the new fundraising rule have strengthened super PACs more than ever, Ravel said.\"I think that all of those things will lead to much more pushing of the envelope,\u201d Ravel said. \"And we already know that there are going to be more and more candidate-aligned super PACs participating in congressional and potentially mayoral and other races.\u201dThe 2016 cycle has explored new frontiers in campaign finance with several candidates forming outside groups to raise and spend money on their behalf before making their White House bid official \u2014 a new experiment in today's complex campaign finance landscape. The dominance of super PAC fundraising and spending has not been without its cautionary tales: Both Scott Walker and Rick Perry, the first two candidates to exit the presidential race, raised tremendous amounts of money for their super PACs, but struggled to pay for their actual campaigns.Even at the higher prices that super PACs must pay for television spots, though, the groups will likely take on a key messaging role as the primaries and the general election get closer.Charlie Spies, a lawyer for the pro-Bush super PAC pushed back on the criticism of creating PACs before campaigns begin, equating the formation of his group prior to the former Florida governor\u2019s announcement to Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton\u2019s family foundation.In a memo to the FEC, he wrote that \u201cshould the Commission not disapprove of the so-called testing the waters activities outlined above \u2014 funded largely by the global non-profit corporation, and subsidized by foreign donations \u2014 we would consider advising our clients to establish similar \u2018global initiative\u2019 type non-profit organizations to house staff, pay for luxury travel, and offset the costs of their pie-candidacy testing the waters activities.\u201dDan Backer, a campaign finance lawyer who represents conservative groups and candidates, said the midterm election in 2018 will likely be when more congressional candidates use the Bush model of raising money for a super PAC before announcing their bids.\"This cycle, it was used in the presidential race,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the 2018 midterms you\u2019re going to see a huge amount of this going on \u2014 if you\u2019re an incumbent you\u2019re kind of screwed by this. It\u2019s actually something that will give challengers an advantage over incumbents for once.\"For now, the Democratic super PACs focused on House and Senate races are silent on whether they will capitalize on the FEC's deadlock in 2016 and beyond and launch candidate-specific super PACs even before candidates announce.\u201cWe believe today's decision will create a somewhat more level playing field moving forward,\u201d said Shripal Shah, spokesman for Senate Majority PAC \u2014 one of the groups who brought the questions before the FEC, in a statement.\n", "title": "A Federal Agency Inadvertently Just Gave Super PACs More Power", "url": "http://www.buzzfeed.com/tariniparti/a-federal-agency-inadvertently-just-gave-super-pacs-more-pow", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Dan Backer", "Ann Ravel", "Scott Olson", "Jeb Bush", "Rick Perry", "John Kasich", "Charlie Spies", "Hillary Clinton", "Marc Elias", "Scott Walker"], "orgs": ["House Majority PAC", "FEC", "PACs", "Senate", "Senate Majority PAC", "Commission", "PAC", "Federal Election Commission"], "election_confidence": 0.9825644726485235, "authors": [{"author_id": 30730, "fullname": "tarini parti", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-11-15 21:36:40", "org": "buzzfeed", "article_id": "b6df9ace55b7773268c17138dc57e4d4", "date_access": "2015-11-15 22:12:54.197643"},

{"body": "", "byline": "", "description": "\nMandel Ngan / AFP / Getty Images\nDES MOINES \u2014 Expectations that sharing a stage with Hillary Clinton in the hours after the terrorist attacks on Paris would make for a rough night for Bernie Sanders melted away minutes into the second Democratic presidential debate here Saturday.The Vermont senator did just fine. But hopes among the Bernie faithful that the debate would give Sanders a chance to regain the extraordinary momentum he lost in October didn\u2019t materialize.Sanders got a chance to be Sanders during the debate \u2014 a back-and-forth over Wall Street ties with Clinton left Hillaryland feeling the Bern, big time \u2014 but he still didn\u2019t move the needle on gun control, where he\u2019s been pummeled by his rivals over past votes against the Brady Bill.And asked twice to attack Clinton on Saturday night, Sanders stopped short, in ways that left some observers scratching their heads.If the takeaway moment from the first debate was Sanders standing up for Clinton on her emails, this time, Sanders was clearly looking for a different soundbite. Earlier in the day on Saturday, his campaign quietly uploaded video of Sanders\u2019s speech on the House floor opposing the Iraq War to its YouTube page. Sanders mentioned his vote against the war and Clinton\u2019s vote for it in his first answer of the debate.After the Iraq war moment, Sanders was asked directly if he could criticize anything specific about Clinton\u2019s term as secretary of state. He didn\u2019t, instead criticizing a raft of U.S. foreign policy moves from decades before.\u201cI think we have a disagreement, and the disagreement is that not only did I vote against the war in Iraq. If you look at history, John, you will find that regime change \u2014 whether it was in the early '50s in Iran, whether it was toppling Salvador Allende in Chile, whether it is overthrowing the government of Guatemala way back when \u2014 these invasions, these toppling of governments, regime changes have unintended consequences,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI would say that on this issue, I'm a little bit more conservative than the secretary and that I am not a great fan of regime change.\u201dAnd after the back-and-forth over Clinton\u2019s Wall Street donors \u2014 a moment that gave Sanders, the only candidate besides Donald Trump without a super PAC, a time to really shine \u2014 Sanders similarly held back.Asked \u201cwhat is it in Secretary Clinton's record that shows you that she's been influenced\u201d by her Wall Street donors, Sanders replied that Clinton is opposed to reinstituting the Glass-Steagall law, which banned commerical and investment banks from being combined. But he didn\u2019t directly tie Clinton\u2019s votes to her Wall Street donors.This was after Sanders said Clinton\u2019s claim that her millions in Wall Street donations have no power over her politics was \u201cNot good enough.\u201dIn the spin room after the debate, Sanders campaign guru Tad Devine said Sanders walking away from chances to more directly call out Clinton was part of a strategy.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you why: Bernie Sanders is not looking to have a negative campaign with Hillary Clinton. I know there\u2019s a lot of appetite for it, I know people are looking for negative politics, but it is not the politics he practices,\u201d Devine said. \u201cThis campaign is never going to be about attacking her, and pushing back on her and diminishing her.\u201dGuns, the area where Clinton and the third man on the stage, Martin O\u2019Malley, have attacked Sanders the most, still proved to be a tough spot for the Vermont senator. Sanders was asked several times if his votes against the Brady Bill were a mistake, especially given that today he supports essentially the same gun control agenda as his rivals. He first refused to say that it was and then eventually stood quietly and said nothing while the moderator asked a final time. O\u2019Malley jumped into the silence to make his own points, bailing Sanders out.Devine said the mistake question was frivolous.\u201cIf you go back 25 or 30 years, the situation was completely different than the situation we confront today,\u201d Devine said, citing the mass shootings that have come to define the gun debate in recent years. \u201cI think when you go back and say, \u2018I would have done this that or the other thing differently,\u2019 I think it\u2019s not completely honest. You can say what you want about Bernie Sanders but you can\u2019t say the guy\u2019s not honest.\u201d\n", "title": "Bernie Sanders Has A Fine Night In Des Moines", "url": "http://www.buzzfeed.com/evanmcsan/bernie-sanders-has-a-fine-night-in-des-moines", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Brady Bill", "Martin O'Malley", "Hillary Clinton", "Mandel Ngan", "Donald Trump", "Bernie Sanders", "Tad Devine"], "orgs": ["PAC", "DES MOINES"], "election_confidence": 0.9675354344071934, "authors": [{"author_id": 6685, "fullname": "evan mcmorris-santoro", "primary_org": "buzzfeed"}], "date_written": "2015-11-15 07:33:02", "org": "buzzfeed", "article_id": "fe0579d2968aa1430723f4650a4f3357", "date_access": "2015-11-15 08:09:09.296893"},

{"body": " (CNN)CNN Opinion asked a range of contributors for their take on the second Democratic presidential debate held at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. Who were the winner and loser? The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors.\n\nThis debate was more difficult for Hillary Clinton than was expected. Though she had opportunities to highlight her extensive experience and leadership skills, she was still thrown on the defense in two pivotal areas. \nOn foreign policy, in the aftermath of Paris, she was forced to defend the record of the Obama administration in Syria and saw how this issue -- foreign policy -- could be turned against her. This, more than the vote in Iraq, will be a challenge.\nDomestic policy also remained a concern as Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley hit harder in her ties to Wall Street and more centrist views on some economic issues. \nClinton still exits from the debate as the most formidable candidate in the group and the one best positioned to defeat the GOP. O'Malley continues to struggle gaining any traction and Sanders still seems too left for the party.\nBut the debate was a warning. It brought out some of the questions that Clinton will face in the coming months. In the coming weeks, she will need to provide stronger answers if she wants a smooth victory in the primaries and the general election. \nWinner: No clear winner.\nLoser: Martin O'Malley. \nJulian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America fellow. He is the author of \"The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society\" and co-editor of a new book, \"Medicare and Medicaid at 50: America's Entitlement Programs in the Age of Affordable Care.\" \n\nThe good news for Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley was that they shared a victory in this debate by criticizing Hillary Clinton directly and to her face, pushing back against the notion that Clinton's nomination is inevitable. \nNot if Sanders and O'Malley have anything to say about it.\nWhen asked about the role of Wall Street, Sanders, who has criticized the influence of big-money donors in American politics, said Clinton's many backers from financial corporations are seeking to curry favor with her.\n\"Maybe they're dumb, and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so,\" Sanders said of Clinton's Wall Street donors. \"Why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something, everybody knows it.\"\nClinton, clearly stung by the statement, pointed out that Sanders \"has basically used his answer to impugn my integrity.\" At issue was a call by Sanders and O'Malley to tighten regulatory controls over banking institutions by reviving elements of the now-defunct Glass-Steagall Act.  \nClinton dismissed her critics: \"My proposal is tougher, more comprehensive and more effective,\" she said. But O'Malley called her ideas \"weak tea\" and the cheers Sanders got by taking her on suggest a sizable portion of Democrats want the next president to control Wall Street rather than the other way around. \nThe Sanders-O'Malley duo also scored points by pushing for a $15 minimum wage, considerably higher than the $12 Clinton advocates. The recent nationwide strikes and demonstrations in favor of a $15 minimum wage -- which translates into an annual full-time salary of $31,000 -- show that Sanders and O'Malley are riding a powerful grassroots wave. \nIf Clinton sticks to her $12 proposal, she should expect more verbal slugfests with her opponents -- and a Democratic base that may jump off the Clinton bandwagon if she doesn't move in a more liberal direction.\nErrol Louis is the host of \"Inside City Hall,\" a nightly political show on NY1, a New York all-news channel. \n\nA day after ISIS terrorized Paris in multiple coordinated attacks with guns and suicide bombs, killing over 100 and injuring hundreds more, Democrat frontrunner Hillary Clinton left doubts she's up to the task to protect America. \nIn opening questions on foreign policy during the CBS-moderated debate, Clinton danced around her lack of accomplishments as secretary of state under President Barack Obama. When asked about Obama's Syria policy, Clinton said she disagreed with Obama's strategy from the start and warned him if the United States didn't intervene in Syria, our enemies would fill the void.  \nClinton said the \"Middle East is a complicated region\" and \"the arch of instability.\" Americans don't vote for a president to tell them what they already know. Clinton's textbook responses to foreign policy questions were rote. More disturbing was she couldn't point to any accomplishments as secretary of state other than advising Obama on Osama bin Laden's capture. Libya, Syria, Egypt and Russia all fell apart under her tenure. If elected president, Clinton didn't convince voters she would do anything differently or make America safer, which brings us to terrorism.\nWhen asked if she would declare war against Islam like President Francois Hollande has, Clinton replied no. \"We're not at war with Islam. We're not at war with Muslims.\"  Yet, that's just the problem. Islam is at war with America and the world and we need a president who will finally acknowledges this, not one who shrinks from this challenge. Obama hasn't. In an interview with \"Good Morning America\" that aired the day of the Paris attack, Obama said ISIS had been contained.\nOver the last four years since the civil war unraveled in Syria, ISIS has taken root there, training Muslims from around the world to be jihadists. France has a large population of Muslim nationals, many of whom have freely entered the country. \nAmerica, like Germany and France, have welcomed thousands of Syrian refugees. It won't be long before what happened in Paris makes it's way to our homeland. During the second Democrat debate, Hillary Clinton revealed her biggest strength may be her biggest weakness -- her foreign policy experience.\nCrystal Wright is a conservative writer who runs the blog ConservativeBlackChick.com. She also is a principal at the Baker Wright Group, a communications and public relations firm. You can follow her @GOPBlackChick.\n\nOn a very tough night to talk politics, it seemed all three candidates were a little off their game.\nHillary Clinton was well-positioned coming in to look tough -- and presidential -- on terrorism. But she didn't anticipate Martin O'Malley lurching to her right. \"It is America's fight,\" he corrected her, \"but not solely America's fight.\" With Bernie Sanders attacking from the left, she was suddenly stuck in the middle, playing defense. \nOn the discussion regarding banks and campaign finance, however, Sanders should have had the natural upper hand, but he couldn't land a punch. Clinton won the issue in the room. Sanders also might be the first Democrat to acknowledge raising the minimum wage will have some negative repercussions, which I think will come back to haunt him.\nO'Malley had some blunders as well. He floated a frightening 70% tax rate on the wealthy, unprompted. He walked into a critique from Sanders on the safety of Baltimore, the city he ran as mayor. \nAll told, they each had some unexpected highlights and some surprising misses. When Clinton loses on foreign policy but wins on the banks, you know it's a weird night.\nS.E. Cupp is the author of \"Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media's Attack on Christianity,\" co-author of \"Why You're Wrong About the Right\" and a columnist at the New York Daily News.  \n\nTwo moments in tonight's debate clarified why Bernie Sanders won't assume the role of frontrunner any time soon.  In the first, Sanders reiterated his noble, but politically disastrous, appeal that we all stop talking about Hillary Clinton's (damn) emails.  It's the high road, for sure.  But by extricating her from a scandal that had bedeviled her campaign for months, Sanders has ceded the space needed for Clinton to take flight.\nThe second moment illustrates the difficulty Sanders has faced in winning over African Americans.  When asked about Black Lives Matter, Sanders rattled off a bunch of standard statistics about incarceration and unemployment rates. Clinton, by contrast, acknowledged the profound pain that black mothers feel when they lose their children to violence, and she then paid tribute -- by name -- to some of the young men who have lost their lives to police violence.\nWinner: Hillary Clinton. She came across as shrewd, measured, and worldly.  Nothing about the debate tonight changed the fundamental dynamics of this race. \nMost improved: Martin O'Malley.  He spoke fluidly and forcefully about all manner of issues. He made a showing tonight; it just won't make much of a difference.\nLastly, a note on format.  With just a handful of Democratic contenders left in the race for president, the conversation in tonight's debate sank reasonably deep into policy details. The kinds of zingers and gaffes that separate winners from losers on a stage of ten just don't count for nearly as much on a stage of three.  May the Republicans take notice and winnow their ranks soon.\nWilliam Howell is the Sydney Stein professor in American politics at the University of Chicago. \n\nOnce again, Democrats proved that they are the adults in this race by having a civilized, high-minded and respectful debate about the important issues facing our country.  They also demonstrated they are all better equipped to lead the nation going into the 21st century as we face unprecedented threats from abroad and an economy that needs continued Democratic leadership to fully recover and give middle class voters all the tools they need to succeed.\nThere were fireworks as both Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley tried to take the fight to Hillary Clinton, specifically on her Iraq vote and her connections to Wall Street.  She swatted away the criticisms with ease, with facts, and demonstrated she is best suited to lead the country as president and commander in chief. \nOn foreign policy, her knowledge of the issues, her grasp of the nuances involved in global diplomacy and her determination to implement unparalleled American leadership to defeat ISIS and radical extremist jihadists in the Middle East, put her head and shoulders above the rest, both in the Democratic field as well as all Republicans vying for the presidency. \nOn economic and domestic issues, Clinton underscored differences with Sanders and O'Malley, again showing important nuances on positions such as the minimum wage, college affordability and gun control, showing her grasp of details and the \"weeds\" of these complex issues.  She showed her policies would put middle class families first while ensuring our economy can absorb them without disruption. \nO'Malley had a great debate, showing his passionate progressive positions, at times taking the critique to both of his opponents, but mostly agreeing with them on key issues.  While his resume is impressive and he has many accomplishments to show as Maryland governor, unfortunately, he was not able to have a sufficient breakout moment that will enable him to climb out of the single digits in the polls. \nSanders continued to show his passionate commitment to liberal positions, focusing on climate change and income inequality, both of which are tremendously important to the progressive base.  But his knowledge of foreign policy and issues going on in the Middle East came up wanting and did not inspire broad-based trust needed to be elected as commander In chief.\nAs an issue that is front and center, immigration brought out the best in all of the Democratic candidates -- an easy feat given the contrast with the ridiculous, unworkable, unjust and unelectable positions that are held by most Republicans. \nImportantly, Clinton was the first one to contrast all the Democrats with the Republicans and was the only one to defend President Obama's record.  A brilliant and important move to excite and mobilize the Democratic base.\nOverall, Clinton outshined her Democratic opponents, showing her proposals would pay for the opportunities and the level playing field that would help create more good paying jobs and expand economic growth for those who have been left behind.  And both Sanders and O'Malley took a definitive back seat to Clinton when it came to foreign policy, defense of the homeland and what it takes to confront the challenges we face, tragically demonstrated by last night's Paris attacks. \nMaria Cardona is a political commentator for CNN, a Democratic strategist and principal at the Dewey Square Group.

Martin O'Malley said, \"The truth of the matter is net immigration from Mexico last year was zero.\" He then challenged viewers to fact-check him, and we couldn't resist.\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, net migration from Mexico probably reached zero in 2010, and more Mexicans have left the United States than arrived since then.\nAdditionally, the actual number of Mexicans living in the United States consistently declined throughout 2014. The U.S. Border Patrol also reported that in the 2014 fiscal year, the number of Mexicans apprehended along the border decreased 14% when compared to the 2013 fiscal year.\nThe information we have suggests that the net immigration rate is negative -- which is actually not zero -- but it is close, and probably still supports O'Malley's point.\nVerdict: Mostly true\n", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Democratic debate: CNN's Reality Check team inspects the claims", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/14/politics/democratic-debate-fact-check/index.html", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Bernie Sanders", "Martin O'Malley"], "orgs": ["U.S. Border Patrol", "Pew Research Center"], "election_confidence": 0.5480945459848154, "authors": [{"author_id": 45638, "fullname": "cnn's reality check team", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-11-15 04:09:39", "org": "cnn", "article_id": "5f763ceb49f12a5e357faeff8b4407dd", "date_access": "2015-11-15 04:16:08.650830"},

{"body": "Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University, a New America fellow and author of \"The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n (CNN)Until now, Donald Trump has defied all the expectations. Most of the political experts predicted he would be one of the media-fueled candidates who have emerged in last few primary seasons, propped up by intense coverage and then deflated when reporters turned their attention to another candidate. \nThe Donald has proven to be a much more durable candidate than they expected, maintaining a strong position in national polls as well as in local polling in key primary states such as New Hampshire. He has demonstrated tremendous savvy in keeping the media's attention for a sustained period of time, which is not a total surprise given his deep experience on \"The Apprentice\" as well as the dynamics of what I have called the click-bait primary, where incendiary statements are more likely to win attention than to receive widespread rebuke. \nBut the Republican campaign is starting to enter a new phase where there are a number of questions about how Trump will fare. Now that the early phase of the competition will soon wind down -- a free-for-all primarily revolving around televised debates -- Trump will have to prove his chops if he is to win in Iowa, New Hampshire and the primaries that follow. \nThe most pertinent question has to do with grass-roots organization. In less than three months, the voting will actually begin. When it comes to the caucuses and primaries, old-fashioned retail politics still matters. As Barack Obama proved in 2008, the winner of these contests needs to put together a formidable grass-roots organization to mobilize and bring out the vote.\nIn a few states like Iowa, Trump's campaign has given indications that it understand this. It has brought on some talented figures and started to put together a campaign. In Iowa, Trump scored a success by hiring Chuck Laudner, the grass-roots campaign operative who put together Rick Santorum's surprise victory there in 2012, to handle his operations. \nBut it is not yet clear whether Trump is willing to devote the money or can devote the kind of day-to-day appearances that the campaign will require, and how well-organized his strategic voter mobilization plan will be. Tim Fernholz reported, for instance, that Trump had not even purchased some of the basic voter information databases that are prerequisites for victory. \nTrump has made a point of saying he is self-funding his campaign, trying to draw a contrast with his rivals. While it is true he used some of his money, donations are still funding a lot of his campaign, and it's not clear how much of his fortune he is willing to commit to this effort, particularly if his odds of winning start to diminish.  \nSoon Trump will also have to contend with an actual establishment candidate. The leaders of the Republican Party are starting to coalesce around a main candidate, very likely Sen. Marco Rubio. Trump has thrived in part because the GOP did not yet have a central candidate upon whom to shower its resources and energy. The divisions and uncertainty that have resulted from Jeb Bush's poor run have opened up room in the campaign for some of the \"outsiders\" who have gained support. \nIf party leaders settle on Rubio, or Bush somehow engineers a miraculous comeback, the pressure against outsiders such as Trump will intensify. The party leaders will do much more, through their candidate, to unload blistering political and personal attacks on opponents within the party. Most recently, The Wall Street Journal, a scion of the Republican establishment, published a scathing editorial about how little Trump seemed to know about what was in the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal.  When Trump responded by calling the editors \"dummies\" through a tweet, the paper stood by its comments. \nIf Trump is able to transition to the next phase with his standing in the polls intact, the media still have a lot of exposing to do. Everyone who has followed him since he made a splash on the national scene in 1980s New York as a \"greed is good\" real estate mogul knows there is a long record to explore.\nDespite all the attention he has received thus far, the scrutiny has been relatively contained. Ironically, the fame with which he entered into the contest has diminished the incentive of some reporters to dig more deeply into his life. It is a contrast with candidates such as Ben Carson about whom the media didn't really know much. That made reporters more curious to figure it out. With Trump, and the assumption we know everything there is about him, there has not been as much investigation as we might expect. But if he remains a serious candidate, more scrutiny will focus on his failed business ventures and his rocky marriages. \nThere are a number of important issues that have barely made it onto the radar. For example, a handful of reports have surfaced on how little Trump has given to charity over the years, a measure for the values of a wealthy person who has not been in public service, and the ways in which he has greatly exaggerated and misconstrued the money that he has donated.\nThe Associated Press produced a scathing report in August showing how he has overstated his contributions, how they are small compared with others of his income status, and that they advance his personal interests. This record would not sit well with some voters, who are seeking a populist voice, especially from a billionaire candidate who is now insisting that the wages of workers are too high. \nHis recent attacks on Carson, such as comparing what he called the neurosurgeon's \"pathological temper\" to the sickness of a \"child molester\" have offered a reminder as to just how nasty the thin-skinned businessman can become against his opponents.\nThere are also questions about Trump himself. Thus far he has clearly enjoyed the ride. Yet it is not evident how he will feel as the campaign slog really gets going, with the brutal hours that it requires, and if he starts to fall from his plateau. It is not clear how passionate Trump is about the job and the kind of commitment winning a presidential race requires. \nHe has already made some comments about his willingness to quit if he is not doing well. In October, he told \"Meet the Press\": \"I'm not a masochist. And if I was dropping in the polls, where I saw that I wasn't going to win, why would I continue?\" \nHe gives off a different sentiment than some of the other candidates, such as Rubio, who are clearly willing to invest everything they have for as long as they are still viable. \nFor those who have always doubted whether this is about promoting his brand name as opposed to promoting a vision for the White House, there are doubts about whether he might just be willing to fire himself if this process turned unpleasant. \nThe brutal terrorist attacks in Paris this weekend are also a stark reminder of the immense security challenges that the United States and the world faces. These are serious times that call for extraordinary leaders. In this context, Trump's yelling and insults, combined with questions about whether he would really be up for this job, are likely to become bigger liabilities among voters.\nIt is clear Trump has the potential to survive over the long run, and the state of the Republican Party might give him room to make it much further than anyone suspected. But the going is about to get a lot tougher, and the challenges Trump will have to overcome will intensify in the next few months.\n Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine.\n", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Can Trump survive?", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/15/opinions/zelizer-can-trump-survive/index.html", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Rick Santorum", "Julian Zelizer", "Lyndon Johnson", "Jeb Bush", "Donald Trump", "Marco Rubio", "Barack Obama", "Chuck Laudner", "Ben Carson"], "orgs": ["Republican Party", "Battle for the Great Society", "GOP", "Congress"], "election_confidence": 0.9985304854830003, "authors": [{"author_id": 2537, "fullname": "julian zelizer", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-11-15 16:41:58", "org": "cnn", "article_id": "b7df427329008031e1e26794de6d8913", "date_access": "2015-11-15 17:01:38.530298"},
{"body": " (CNN)Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley met for the second Democratic presidential primary debate on Saturday night, an event that finally saw a fight between the front-runner and her chief opponent, but also coming a day after a deadly terror attack that shocked the world. \nHere are the six key takeaways from the debates:\n\nClinton distanced herself from President Barack Obama's now-controversial comment in an interview Thursday that the U.S. had \"contained ISIS.\" During Saturday's debate, Clinton asserted that ISIS \"cannot be contained\" and must simply be \"defeated.\"\n As she has in the past, Clinton also suggested that she had argued \"early on that we needed to find a way to train and equip moderates.\" Clinton reportedly argued for a more forceful administration plan to help the Syrian opposition early on in the civil war that has since exploded.\nRELATED: Hillary Clinton at Democratic debate: ISIS 'cannot be contained'\n\nThe Vermont senator in the first debate appeared unprepared or unwilling to go after Clinton with any real vigor.\nBut Saturday night, Sanders suggested Clinton is in the pocket of Wall Street and tied her vote to authorize the war in Iraq to the rise of ISIS. Clinton, meanwhile, knocked Sanders on his mixed record on guns and suggested his policy proposals are too simplistic.\nIn the most forceful exchange of the night, Sanders pointed to the millions of dollars in donations Wall Street has funneled to Clinton's campaigns over her political career.\n\"Why over her political career has Wall Street been a major, the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton? Maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so,\" Sanders said. \"I have never heard a candidate, never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street from the military industrial complex, not one candidate -- 'Oh these, these campaign contributions will not influence me.' But why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something, everybody knows that.\"\nRELATED: Democratic debate: CNN's Reality Check team inspects the claims\nClinton responded by accusing Sanders of impugning her \"integrity,\" before claiming that Wall Street has supported her because of the work she did to rebuild the Financial District after it was hit in the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center.  \nAs she did in the first debate, Clinton hit Sanders on guns, calling the Vermont senator's vote to shield gun makers from some lawsuits a \"terrible mistake\" and urging Sanders to admit as much, as she has done regarding her Iraq vote.\nSanders responded by suggesting there's little daylight between himself and Clinton and O'Malley on guns.\n\nSanders didn't take the gloves off completely during Saturday night's debate in Iowa.\nInstead, he took a pass on one of the biggest points of contention of the 2016 cycle: Clinton's record as secretary of state.\nGiven a chance to slam Clinton's tenure, Sanders demurred, instead pivoting to his \"disagreement\" with Clinton over her vote in favor of the Iraq War in 2002, more than six years before she became secretary of state.\nRepublicans are already picking apart Clinton's track record as secretary of state, but Sanders' simply wouldn't take the bait.\nIt was reminiscent of Sanders' \"damn emails\" moment in the first Democratic debate, when he said Americans are tired of hearing about the controversy over Clintons' use of personal email during her time as secretary of state.\n\nHowever, Clinton's response to Sanders -- when she beat back the suggestion that she is influenced by Wall Street donors -- could really come back to bite her.\nClinton explained her connection to Wall Street by tying her relationship to her role in helping to rebuild New York's financial district after the 9/11 attacks.\nTwitter was ablaze Saturday night over the response, and the Republican National Committee was quick to blast out a best-of compilation of political observers' reactions.\nIt's not the only moment that could come back to haunt Clinton -- especially if she faces a younger GOP nominee, like Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida.\nClinton at one point said she is \"from the '60s\" -- a moment in the debate that could be replayed in political ads down the line suggesting she is part of the past, not the future, of American leadership.\n\nThe debate Saturday night began with the candidates pausing on stage, taking a moment of silence to remember the victims of the terrorist attacks that ripped Paris apart just a day earlier.  \nClinton said while \"our prayers are with the people of France tonight...that is not enough\" and called for better coordinated efforts to root out ISIS, the radical group that claimed responsibility. \nShe said Americans should see the terrorist attack as a reminder that the election \"is not only about electing a president, it's also about choosing our next commander in chief.\"\nSanders made brief note of the terrorist attacks at the top of his opening statement, but quickly pivoted to the core message of the campaign: \"a rigged economy\" that benefits billionaires.\nStill, Sanders made a bold claim in his reference to Paris: \"Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of this barbarist (sic) organization called ISIS.\"\nAnd O'Malley, after saying his heart goes out \"to the people of France in this moment of loss,\" quickly called for \"fresh thinking\" and \"new approaches\" -- a definitive nod to his youth and the generational contrast the  52-year-old offers to Clinton's 68 years and Sanders' 74.\nAll three candidates refused to say the fight was with radical Islam, instead focusing on using the word \"jihadist\" to describe the threats spotlighted in the Paris attacks. \nRELATED: Clinton calls out 'radical jihadist ideology'\n\nO'Malley delivered several strong one-liners throughout the night, notably when he slammed Republican front-runner Donald Trump as a \"carnival barker\" for his immigration policies.\nBut O'Malley also missed a couple of key moments where he could have shined. \nHis central contention is that it's time for a new generation of leadership -- meaning no more baby boomers like Clinton. But he lacked a strong, convincing response to one of the debate's final questions: When have you been most tested in your life, and how did it prepare you for the presidency? \nO'Malley's response conceded that he is untested -- that nothing he's been through as mayor of Baltimore or governor of Maryland comes close to the crises he would face as President.\nTrump later responded to O'Malley's insult on Twitter by calling him a \"clown.\" \n", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Takeaways from the Democratic presidential debate", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/15/politics/democratic-debate-key-takeaways/index.html", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Martin O'Malley", "Hillary Clinton", "Donald Trump", "Marco Rubio", "Barack Obama", "Bernie Sanders"], "orgs": ["World Trade Center", "Republican National Committee", "GOP"], "election_confidence": 0.9948085516716363, "authors": [{"author_id": 2323, "fullname": "jeremy diamond", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-11-15 05:40:18", "org": "cnn", "article_id": "c28fb23d87e1883fc57bffcce551dc8f", "date_access": "2015-11-15 06:01:45.852422"},

Bernie Sanders repeatedly criticized her for taking money from the financial sector and questioned whether she had the independence to overhaul the industry.\n\u201cI represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked,\u201d Clinton pointed out. \u201cWhere were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York.\u201d\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus slammed Clinton for the comments after the debate in Des Moines ended.\n\u201c[I]n a new low, Hillary Clinton shamefully hid behind the 9/11 terrorist attacks in a bizarre attempt to deflect attention from her ties to her wealthy donors,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nThe backlash also surfaced during the CBS-hosted debate itself. Shortly after Clinton made the remarks, the moderators cited social media reaction, including a tweet saying she had invoked 9/11 to justify Wall Street donations.\n\u201cWell, I'm sorry that whoever tweeted that had that impression because I worked closely with New Yorkers after 9/11 for my entire first term to rebuild,\u201d Clinton said.\nSanders acknowledged she was the senator from New York at the time and did help rebuild. But he also said Wall Street has too much power.\nEarlier, he suggested Clinton would not be able to overhaul the industry given its support for her.\n\u201cLet's not be naive about it. Why \u2026has Wall Street been the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.\u201d\nEven Clinton\u2019s former campaign manager, Patti Solis Doyle, questioned the 9/11 reference following the debate.\n\u201cI do think that the 9/11 reference was probably better used when she was talking about terrorism. She was the senator when the 9/11 attacks happened. She was the senator when we needed to rebuild that city.

It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief,\u201d she said.\nBut, citing the chaos in the Middle East and North Africa, Clinton\u2019s rivals soon turned to her record as U.S. senator and later as secretary of state to question her judgment in foreign policy matters.\nO\u2019Malley appeared to criticize her support for toppling Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi.\nHe said America\u2019s role is not to roam the world \u201clooking for new dictators to topple.\u201d He said it is also important to understand \u201csecondary and third consequences\u201d that come after removing a \u201csingle dictator.\u201d O\u2019Malley called Libya, Syria and other countries in the region a \u201cmess.\u201d\nClinton defended her support for ousting Qaddafi, saying he was threatening a \u201cgenocide\u201d and America\u2019s European and Arab allies asked for U.S. support. And to O\u2019Malley\u2019s critique, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t think you can paint with a broad brush\u201d in an \u201cincredibly complicated region of the world.\u201d\nSanders, meanwhile, referenced Clinton\u2019s Senate vote for the use of force in Iraq and said the \u201cdisastrous invasion\u201d led \u201cto the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS.\u201d The senator also claimed that \u201cclimate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.\u201d\nClinton again called her Iraq war vote a \u201cmistake,\u201d but disputed that the war is the only driver of modern terrorism.\nShe and O\u2019Malley briefly sparred over America\u2019s role in fighting ISIS. After Clinton said it \u201ccannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential,\u201d O\u2019Malley said, \u201cThis actually is America\u2019s fight,\u201d though not \u201csolely\u201d America\u2019s fight.\nSanders staked out a different position in saying it is the nations in the region that \u201chave to get their hands dirty.\u201d\n\u201cThose Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort,\u201d he said.\nThe candidates declined to categorize the threat itself as \u201cradical Islam.\u201d Asked about that categorization, Clinton said only, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re at war with Islam.\u201d\nAll the candidates on stage condemned the Paris terror attacks and vowed to take on the threat of terror.\n\u201cIt cannot be contained. It must be defeated,\u201d Clinton said of ISIS, appearing to distance herself from President Obama, who hours before the Paris attacks claimed ISIS was \u201ccontained.\u201d\nThe attacks across multiple locations in Paris killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds, officials said. It brought the issue of terrorism to the forefront of both party\u2019s presidential primary races. Ostensibly, it is an area where Clinton enters with the thickest resume \u2013 but also one that could, as the debate showed, prove problematic given her involvement shaping the policies in increasingly unstable nations like Libya and Syria.\nWhile the tragedy hung over the debate, the candidates were able to tackle of range of domestic issues including wages and immigration.\nO\u2019Malley landed virtually the only shot of the night against Republican candidate Donald Trump, a favorite target of the Democrats, by calling him an \u201cimmigrant-bashing carnival barker.\u201d The Democratic candidates generally agree on the call for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the country.\nSanders, meanwhile, continued to advocate for a $15 minimum wage.\nBut the candidates were divided on gun control. While Clinton has tried in the past to cast Sanders as soft on the issue, O\u2019Malley accused Clinton of being \u201con three sides of this.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you ran in 2000, you said we needed federal robust regulations, then in 2008 you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying we don't need those regulations ... and now you\u2019re coming back around here,\u201d he said.\nThe debate was notable in that it saw Sanders and O\u2019Malley taking a more aggressive tone against the front-runner, who seemed to have strengthened her hand since their initial debate.\nSince that debate, two candidates have dropped out, leaving only Sanders and O\u2019Malley. She also made it through a lengthy hearing before the Benghazi congressional committee and saw one of her biggest potential political threats \u2013 a late bid by Vice President Biden \u2013 disappear as the vice president announced he would not run.\nSanders remains Clinton\u2019s biggest challenge, and has stirred an enthusiasm in the Democratic base that Clinton has struggled to evoke. But nationally and in Iowa, she continues to lead him by double digits in the polls.\nStill, the FBI investigation over Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email and server while secretary of state looms over her bid, with the probe said to be expanding. Sanders appeared to give her a pass on the email issue at the first debate by saying he was tired of hearing about the controversy.\nSanders, though, stood by his comments at the second debate Saturday night: \u201cI was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email, I\u2019m still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email. \u2026 Let\u2019s go to the major issues facing America.\u201d\u00a0", "byline": "", "description": "Hillary Clinton faced tough criticism Saturday night from her Democratic rivals over everything from her Middle East policies to her swaying stance on gun control to her Wall Street ties, at a debate that saw both Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley step up their attacks on the party\u2019s front-runner.\u00a0\u00a0", "title": "Clinton hit by Dem rivals over Wall St. ties, Mideast policies at 2nd debate", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/V8TEBB0dgZ8/", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security", "immigration"], "people": ["Martin O'Malley", "Jim Young", "Hillary Clinton", "Donald Trump", "Muammar Qaddafi", "Bernie Sanders"], "orgs": ["Senate", "Al Qaeda", "FBI"], "election_confidence": 0.9974292038547423, "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-11-15 05:15:16", "org": "fox", "article_id": "29828bcd7ecc03e34848b99e5ee11039", "date_access": "2015-11-15 06:14:40.351600"},

It was uttered on a night when her opponents were more direct in their criticism but still did not appear to lay a glove on her. \u00a0\nIndeed, O\u2019Malley\u2019s words are poignant, but ultimately won\u2019t make much of a difference. Hillary Clinton is 19 points up nationally and Saturday night\u2019s debate was another example of why she is so far in front.\nJust as in the first debate, Clinton showed the depth of her experience in politics over the last 30 years. She has the deepest understanding of the issues \u2013 particularly foreign policy having been secretary of state \u2013 and is a sharp, quick debater.\n\nNone of the candidates were willing to say that we\u2019re at war with radical Islam. Everyone was watching for this and it seemed that they erred on the side of political correctness. \n\nClinton continued to show herself to be a commanding force on the stage. This isn\u2019t to say that she didn\u2019t have struggles.\nShe tripped up during an answer about Wall Street where she countered that her work to aid the 9/11 recovery while a New York senator made her a crusader against Wall Street. And her vote for the Iraq war haunted her again. These are points the GOP will seize upon and showed flashes of weakness.\nSaturday debate began with a series of questions on terrorism and how America can combat ISIS, especially in light of the heinous attacks in Paris on Friday night. We knew this would happen, as it should. And each of the candidates emphasized how important American leadership is in the fight against terrorism, something I agree with wholeheartedly.\nIt was no surprise that Clinton was the most hawkish of the three candidates on stage. She talked of using airpower, training and equipping forces in the region and pushes our allies \u2013 especially Turkey and the Gulf States \u2013 to make up their minds about how much they\u2019re going to help in this effort. Sanders and O\u2019Malley had good rhetoric on the issue, but were vague and non-specific. And we also heard again that climate change is creating terrorism from Sanders \u2013 a claim that the Republicans will surely seize on.\nIt must be noted that Clinton was trying to distance herself from Obama's statement that ISIS needs to be \"contained\" by saying they need to be \"defeated.\" That being said, she did not declare war on ISIS. She did not forthrightly speak of the singular and unique role the U.S. must play in providing leadership, and sought to deflect attention from Sanders' efforts to link her with the rise of ISIS because of her support of the Iraq war by blaming George Bush.\nIn short, it was a good and effective job for a Democratic primary audience, but all three candidates were on the defensive for much of the first part of the debate over the Middle East and the War on Terror. This will probably be a manageable challenge in the Democratic primary, but will almost certainly be a more serious challenge during the general election campaign. We will have to watch how this unfolds closely.\nFurthermore, none of the candidates were willing to say that we\u2019re at war with radical Islam. Everyone was watching for this and it seemed that they erred on the side of political correctness.\nClinton had the best rationale for not using the term by defending it in terms of not offending our Muslim allies, but coming on the day after the Paris attacks, I\u2019m sure this will be an issue.\nThere was more antagonism on Saturday night than we\u2019ve seen before. Sanders went after Clinton for her close ties to Wall Street and on gun control. And Clinton returned the favor.\nO\u2019Malley got in on the action to tout how far he went as Maryland governor to raise wages, control gun violence and work to combat climate change. He certainly did better than he has before, but I don\u2019t think he made a strong case for an O\u2019Malley presidency. As Sanders pointed out, it\u2019s not like Baltimore is doing too well right now. And he\u2019s right.\nThe most important thing that voters will have seen at the Iowa debate this week is that a Clinton and a Sanders presidency would be very different.\nSanders believes two things are of paramount importance: income inequality and climate change. His plans could push taxes on the rich upwards of 80 percent-- in a light moment he joked about Dwight Eisenhower levying a 90% tax -- and he\u2019d bring back Glass-Steagall and break up the banks. Sanders supports a $15 minimum wage and free college tuition. And he brought the conversation on health care back to the idea of single payer, a favorite of the progressive left.\nThese are all areas where you can see differences with Clinton. She only supports a $12 federal minimum wage and said it should be up to states/cities to raise it above that (this is also what Senate Democrats support). She wouldn\u2019t break up the banks or bring back Glass-Steagall while at the same time arguing that her proposals go the furthest in reining in the banks.\nOn health care, Clinton wants to build on ObamaCare and improve it, especially by focusing on the issue of prescription drug costs.\nIt\u2019s also important to note that all the candidates were allied on immigration \u2013 each supports comprehensive immigration plan and a pathway to citizenship.\nMartin O\u2019Malley was the only candidate to say how many Syrian refugees he\u2019d take in (65,000), but they all argued that it\u2019s our humanitarian duty to take in refugees. This will also be a sticking point after the Paris attacks.\nAll this is to say that Saturday night\u2019s event was a well-moderated debate and all the candidates did well.\nIt\u2019s just that Clinton did that much better. She\u2019s the only one on stage who looked presidential. And I believe everyone could see that. \n\nDouglas E. Schoen has served as a pollster for President Bill Clinton.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt,, Hillary Rodham Clinton and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, Friday, Nov. 13, 2015, in Des Moines, Iowa. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)\n\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders needs to slow frontrunner Hillary Clinton\u2019s run toward the party nomination, and Saturday night\u2019s debate might be such an opportunity.\nThe format of the CBS debate, the second of the 2016 cycle for Democratic White House candidates, was reworked after the Paris terror attacks Friday night to focus more on terrorism, national security and foreign policy.\nClinton, as a former secretary of state, has more experience with such matters, compared to both Sanders, a Vermont independent, and fellow challenger Martin O\u2019Malley, a former Maryland governor.\nHowever, her record as the State Department leader from 2009 to 2013 could also invite moderator questions and candidate attacks Saturday about her handling of the deadly Sept. 11, 2012, terror attacks on a U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya.\nAmong the concerns, as frequently highlighted by Republicans, are whether Clinton paid enough attention to security concerns raised by Ambassador Christopher Stevens, who was killed in the attacks, and whether she attempted to cover up that the attacks were terror related.\n\nStevens and three other Americans died in the attacks.\nClinton will also likely face questions at the debate in Des Moines, Iowa, about her role in the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to eradicate the Islamic State, the increasingly dangerous terror group that has claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks that killed at least 129 people.\nClinton leads Sanders 54.7 percent to 33 percent, with O\u2019Malley at a distant 2.7 percent, according to an averaging of polls by the nonpartisan website RealClearPolitics.com.\nAnd an Associated Press survey of superdelegates published Friday found that half of the Democratic insiders are publicly backing Clinton, which further secures her nomination efforts.\nClinton\u2019s campaign got off to a rough start following revelations about eight months ago that as secretary of state she used a private server and email accounts for official business, which raised questions about whether classified information was compromised.\nHowever, the former first lady and New York senator has been on a recent roll, which started with a good first debate in mid-October and was followed about a week later by her well-prepared testimony before a GOP-led special House committee on the Benghazi matter.\nSanders, a self-described Democratic socialist whose outsider campaign has drawn large crowds and good polling numbers in early-voting states Iowa and New Hampshire, will indeed be free to attack Clinton on foreign policy.\nHowever, his focus on such domestic issues as income inequality, affordable college tuition and social justice reform could present problems Saturday if Clinton or the moderators go deep and hard into the foreign policy issues.\nSanders may have inadvertently facilitated some of Clinton\u2019s turnaround when in the first debate he seemed to dismiss the controversy over her use of a private email account and server by saying Americans are tired of hearing about her \"damn emails.\"\nBut he has since given her no more passes.\nThough careful never to mention Clinton by name, Sanders has drawn a series of contrasts with the former secretary of State on issues that include her backing of the war in Iraq, trade and the minimum wage.\nSanders advisers say he plans to discuss the email issue only if the moderators raise it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"He's definitely going to cut a harder contrast on core issues,\" said Larry Cohen, a senior adviser to Sanders, \"But it's not going to be over personal style.\"\nThe problem for Sanders is that Clinton agrees with him on some of the core domestic issues of his campaign, having shifted to the left in recent weeks to oppose construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.\n\"His current arguments aren't enough to get beyond his core voter,\" said Gina Glantz, manager of Bill Bradley's 2000 presidential campaign.\nWhile Sanders aides bragged about their candidate's lax preparation for the last debate, they shuttled him to his campaign headquarters in Burlington, Vermont, for mock sessions before this match-up. Clinton, too, has kept her schedule relatively clear over the last several days, leaving plenty of time for rehearsals.\n\"They are absolutely prepared for the fact that Bernie's going to come out swinging,\" said Maria Cardona, a Democratic strategist who worked for Clinton's failed 2008 White House campaign, \"The question is how it's going to happen.\"\nClinton supporters say their candidate will remain focused on laying out her vision for the future rather than striking back at Sanders. Her campaign has about $15.2 million in television advertising planned through mid-February, compared with a $3.2 million Sanders ad buy that ends next week, according to Kantar Media's CMAG advertising tracker.\nThe Service Employees International Union, an influential force in Democratic politics, is expected to issue their endorsement on Tuesday, according to people knowledgeable about the union's process. Clinton has been backed by more than 72 percent of members in all their internal polling, including the most recent survey conducted a few weeks ago.\nIn addition to her success in the first debate and on Capitol Hill, Clinton has benefited from Vice President Joe Biden's decision to forgo a presidential run.\nO'Malley has questioned Sanders' commitment to the Democratic Party and President Obama, still a popular figure among Democrats.\nA more aggressive tone would mark a shift for a race that has so far been notable for its civility. Democrats have spent months boasting about the substantive tone of their contest, attempting to set-up a favorable early contrast with the often carnival-like insults of the crowded Republican primary.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0", "byline": "", "description": "Democrat presidential challenger Sen.

{"body": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nWith the terrible tragedy in Paris Friday, the focus of the second Democratic debate on CBS changed correctly from the economy and domestic issues, to national security and immigration. However, the bickering back and forth between the two candidates going nowhere and the probable nominee -- Mrs. Clinton, really got off the subject very quickly.\nHillary said she would be tougher than President Obama. I don't doubt that she will be but that's a pretty low bar.\nBernie Sanders, in spite of Friday's terror attacks in Paris, still thinks climate warming is the world\u2019s greatest problem and the root of all evil.\nMartin O\u2019Malley is prepared to become president because he led Baltimore for 8 years as mayor and the greatest state in the country, Maryland for another four as governor. He must have forgotten that we all got to watch Baltimore explode on national TV a few months back.\nSanders thinks Hillary is owned by Wall Street and the Super-PACS and can't be trusted. After hearing O\u2019Malley brag about everything he did in Maryland, I don't know why everyone wouldn't want to live there.\n\nThe overall message of the night was the Democrats agree on most things. Including, if they would be honest, that Hillary's going to be the nominee. \n\nHis great strength is that he looks like he could play a president in a TV show like \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d \u00a0But in reality, he's lucky the Democrats don't have a junior varsity table or he'd be sitting there by himself.\nThe overall message of the night was the Democrats agree on most things. Including, if they would be honest, that Hillary's going to be the nominee.\nOn policy there is little disagreement. First they still believe in redistribution of wealth (the Robin Hood Theory). The rich are too rich and need to pay more in taxes. The upper limit was not quite the 90%\u00a0 rate in the Eisenhower administration but close (thank you, Bernie Sanders) to certainly a much higher rate for the upper income earners.\nThe middle class is not what it used to be so therefore the government must do something to change all this.\nThe banks and the drug companies and the insurance companies are too big and they are all bad guys so we must regulate them and watch out for them cheating or getting rich.\nWe need more free programs paid for by tax payers. Free public college education for all.\nTo Hillary's credit she didn't buy into this because she doesn't want taxpayers to pay to educate Donald Trump\u2019s kids.\nStill, there was lots of talk about free health care for all and cheap drugs, too.\nWho is going to pay for all this? The rich guys, of course.\nOn immigration, we should just let the 11 million immigrants who are here illegally stay because they've been here a long time.\nSanders , the avowed Socialist, who represents Vermont, the second smallest state in the Union, kept talking about how great Canada is. Maybe that's because Canada just elected a socialist prime minister.\nHe did waffle on guns a little from the Democratic \u00a0position but I am sure that's because nearly every voter in Vermont owns a couple of them.\nThe hardest working guy in the room was John Dickerson, who was the CBS moderator. His biggest task was making sure CBS got its commercial breaks every 10 minutes. About half way through, I confess, I realized that I can't wait for the next \u201cTrump Invitational\u201d as the Republican debates are sometimes called. At least they are not dull! This one was so dull, the network ended it 7 minutes early!\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nEdward J. Rollins is a Fox News contributor.

(REUTERS/Jim Young)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\nHillary Clinton faced tough criticism Saturday night from her Democratic rivals over everything from her Middle East policies to her swaying stance on gun control to her Wall Street ties, at a debate that saw both Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley step up their attacks on the party\u2019s front-runner.\nThe former secretary of state was put on the defensive almost immediately, as she was challenged by her rivals -- and the moderator -- over military interventions she backed in countries now gripped by instability. Vermont Sen. Sanders ripped her support for \u201cregime change.\u201d \u00a0\nBut while the Paris terror attacks the night before shifted the early presidential debate focus to national security, the candidates sparred aggressively in the latter half over domestic issues \u2013 especially financial industry reform and Clinton\u2019s Wall Street support.\nFormer Maryland Gov. O\u2019Malley called her the \u201ccandidate of Wall Street.\u201d\nAsked about her hefty Wall Street-backed speaking fees and donations, Clinton defended her independence in being able to pursue financial industry reform.\n\nBut Sanders shot back, \u201cNot good enough.\u201d\n\u201cLet's not be naive about it. Why \u2026has Wall Street been the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.\u201d\nHe and O\u2019Malley, unlike Clinton, both want to re-instate a Depression-era banking law known as Glass-Steagall \u2013 and they both criticized Clinton\u2019s Wall Street plans as not going far enough.\u00a0\nO\u2019Malley called it \u201cweak tea.\u201d\nIn an eyebrow-raising moment, Clinton countered Sanders\u2019 criticism of her Wall Street donations by saying that as New York senator, she helped \u201crebuild\u201d Wall Street and downtown Manhattan after 9/11.\nClinton was later asked about social media reaction claiming she had invoked 9/11 to justify financial industry donations; Clinton said she\u2019s sorry that anyone had that \u201cimpression.\u201d\nMeanwhile, she said she doesn\u2019t think her rivals\u2019 financial industry plans \u2013 particularly to reinstate the Depression-era law that separated investment and commercial banking \u2013 would get the job done.\n\u201cI'm all about making sure we actually get results,\u201d Clinton said.\nThe debate in Des Moines, Iowa, came in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, which thrust the issues of national security and foreign policy back to the center of the 2016 campaign. The format of the debate \u2013 hosted by CBS News, KCCI-TV and The Des Moines Register -- was changed to focus anew on those issues in the beginning.\nClinton tried to highlight her deep experience in foreign policy issues from the outset.\n\u201cThis election is not only about electing a president. It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief,\u201d she said.\nBut, citing the chaos in the Middle East and North Africa, Clinton\u2019s rivals soon turned to her record as U.S. senator and later as secretary of state to question her judgment in foreign policy matters.\nO\u2019Malley appeared to criticize her support for toppling Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi.\nHe said America\u2019s role is not to roam the world \u201clooking for new dictators to topple.\u201d He said it is also important to understand \u201csecondary and third consequences\u201d that come after removing a \u201csingle dictator.\u201d O\u2019Malley called Libya, Syria and other countries in the region a \u201cmess.\u201d\nClinton defended her support for ousting Qaddafi, saying he was threatening a \u201cgenocide\u201d and America\u2019s European and Arab allies asked for U.S. support. And to O\u2019Malley\u2019s critique, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t think you can paint with a broad brush\u201d in an \u201cincredibly complicated region of the world.\u201d\nSanders, meanwhile, referenced Clinton\u2019s Senate vote for the use of force in Iraq and said the \u201cdisastrous invasion\u201d led \u201cto the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS.\u201d The senator also claimed that \u201cclimate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.\u201d\nClinton again called her Iraq war vote a \u201cmistake,\u201d but disputed that the war is the only driver of modern terrorism.\nShe and O\u2019Malley briefly sparred over America\u2019s role in fighting ISIS. After Clinton said it \u201ccannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential,\u201d O\u2019Malley said, \u201cThis actually is America\u2019s fight,\u201d though not \u201csolely\u201d America\u2019s fight.\nSanders staked out a different position in saying it is the nations in the region that \u201chave to get their hands dirty.\u201d\n\u201cThose Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort,\u201d he said.\nThe candidates declined to categorize the threat itself as \u201cradical Islam.\u201d Asked about that categorization, Clinton said only, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re at war with Islam.\u201d\nAll the candidates on stage condemned the Paris terror attacks and vowed to take on the threat of terror.\n\u201cIt cannot be contained. It must be defeated,\u201d Clinton said of ISIS, appearing to distance herself from President Obama, who hours before the Paris attacks claimed ISIS was \u201ccontained.\u201d\nThe attacks across multiple locations in Paris killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds, officials said. It brought the issue of terrorism to the forefront of both party\u2019s presidential primary races. Ostensibly, it is an area where Clinton enters with the thickest resume \u2013 but also one that could, as the debate showed, prove problematic given her involvement shaping the policies in increasingly unstable nations like Libya and Syria.\nWhile the tragedy hung over the debate, the candidates were able to tackle of range of domestic issues including wages and immigration.\nO\u2019Malley landed virtually the only shot of the night against Republican candidate Donald Trump, a favorite target of the Democrats, by calling him an \u201cimmigrant-bashing carnival barker.\u201d The Democratic candidates generally agree on the call for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the country.\nSanders, meanwhile, continued to advocate for a $15 minimum wage.\nBut the candidates were divided on gun control. While Clinton has tried in the past to cast Sanders as soft on the issue, O\u2019Malley accused Clinton of being \u201con three sides of this.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you ran in 2000, you said we needed federal robust regulations, then in 2008 you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying we don't need those regulations ... and now you\u2019re coming back around here,\u201d he said.\nThe debate was notable in that it saw Sanders and O\u2019Malley taking a more aggressive tone against the front-runner, who seemed to have strengthened her hand since their initial debate.\nSince that debate, two candidates have dropped out, leaving only Sanders and O\u2019Malley. She also made it through a lengthy hearing before the Benghazi congressional committee and saw one of her biggest potential political threats \u2013 a late bid by Vice President Biden \u2013 disappear as the vice president announced he would not run.\nSanders remains Clinton\u2019s biggest challenge, and has stirred an enthusiasm in the Democratic base that Clinton has struggled to evoke. But nationally and in Iowa, she continues to lead him by double digits in the polls.\nStill, the FBI investigation over Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email and server while secretary of state looms over her bid, with the probe said to be expanding. Sanders appeared to give her a pass on the email issue at the first debate by saying he was tired of hearing about the controversy.\nSanders, though, stood by his comments at the second debate Saturday night: \u201cI was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email, I\u2019m still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email. \u2026 Let\u2019s go to the major issues facing America.\u201d\u00a0", "byline": "", "description": "Hillary Clinton faced tough criticism Saturday night from her Democratic rivals over everything from her Middle East policies to her swaying stance on gun control to her Wall Street ties, at a debate that saw both Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley step up their attacks on the party\u2019s front-runner.\u00a0\u00a0", "title": "Clinton hit by Dem rivals over Wall St. ties, Mideast policies at 2nd debate", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/V8TEBB0dgZ8/", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security", "immigration"], "people": ["Martin O'Malley", "Jim Young", "Hillary Clinton", "Donald Trump", "Muammar Qaddafi", "Bernie Sanders"], "orgs": ["Senate", "Al Qaeda", "FBI"], "election_confidence": 0.9974292038547423, "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-11-15 05:15:16", "org": "fox", "article_id": "79bd7c26a3cede5c90902c1c11117ed4", "date_access": "2015-11-15 06:14:21.385069"},

Martin O'Malley. The campaign\u2019s objections were first reported by Yahoo News.\nSanders aides noted on the call that in 90-second opening statements all three candidates could choose to spend their time on terror or other topics, and in the end they prevailed on organizers to keep the longer opening statements.\nIn the end, the candidates agreed to hold their opening statements to 60 seconds\n\nHowever, the Sanders camp was still not pleased that CBS planned to spend significant time early in the debate on national security after the lead moderator, John Dickerson of CBS, in recent days privately told the campaigns and publicly said in media interviews that the primary focus would be on income inequality and other economic topics.\nIn the wake of the terror attacks, the Clinton and O'Malley camps expressed support for the topic shift on the conference call, according to the Democratic sources.\nThe objections by the Sanders camp fueled talk among Democrats in Iowa that the senator is worried he cannot match the former secretary of state's stature on national security.\nSanders aides reject this by saying he will focus on how judgment on national security is more important than experience.

Say it with me: \u2018Radical Islamic terrorism.\u201d\nThe Islamic State has taken credit for the three coordinated attacks in and around Paris that killed 129 people and wounded more than 350.\nFrench President Francois Hollande called the attacks \u201can act of war\u201d by the terror group ISIS, which claimed responsibility for the strikes.\nDuring the debate at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, Sanders said he didn\u2019t think the term \u201cis what's important.\u201d\nHe argued the real issue is groups such as ISIS and Al Qaeda, and their mistreatment of women and children, have become \u201ca danger to modern society\u201d and that \u201cAmerican leadership can and must come together to destroy them.\u201d\nO\u2019Malley, like Clinton and Sanders, also took special consideration not to offend the entire Muslim community.\n\u201cI believe calling it what it is \u2026 radical jihadis,\u201d he said. \u201cLet's not fall into the trap of thinking that all of our Muslim-American neighbors in this country are somehow our enemies here. They are our first line of defense. \u2026 We need our Muslim-American neighbors to stand up and to be a part of this.\u201d\nGOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush tweeted on Saturday: \u201cYes, we are at war with radical Islamic terrorism.\u201d\nDuring the debate, Clinton also was asked about a December 2014 speech in which she said it\u2019s important to show \u201crespect even for one's enemy\u201d and to try to \u201cempathize with their perspective and point of view.\u201d\nClinton responded: \u201cIt is important to try to understand your adversary in order to figure out how they are thinking, what they will be doing, how they will react.\u201d\nClinton campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri told Yahoo News after the debate that she didn\u2019t think Clinton was getting a lot of criticism for remarks.\n\u201cI think she was really clear that we don\u2019t need to go to war,\u201d Palmieri said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to go to war with Islam.

{"body": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nWith the terrible tragedy in Paris Friday, the focus of the second Democratic debate on CBS changed correctly from the economy and domestic issues, to national security and immigration. However, the bickering back and forth between the two candidates going nowhere and the probable nominee -- Mrs. Clinton, really got off the subject very quickly.\nHillary said she would be tougher than President Obama. I don't doubt that she will be but that's a pretty low bar.\nBernie Sanders, in spite of Friday's terror attacks in Paris, still thinks climate warming is the world\u2019s greatest problem and the root of all evil.\nMartin O\u2019Malley is prepared to become president because he led Baltimore for 8 years as mayor and the greatest state in the country, Maryland for another four as governor. He must have forgotten that we all got to watch Baltimore explode on national TV a few months back.\nSanders thinks Hillary is owned by Wall Street and the Super-PACS and can't be trusted. After hearing O\u2019Malley brag about everything he did in Maryland, I don't know why everyone wouldn't want to live there.\n\nThe overall message of the night was the Democrats agree on most things. Including, if they would be honest, that Hillary's going to be the nominee. \n\nHis great strength is that he looks like he could play a president in a TV show like \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d \u00a0But in reality, he's lucky the Democrats don't have a junior varsity table or he'd be sitting there by himself.\nThe overall message of the night was the Democrats agree on most things. Including, if they would be honest, that Hillary's going to be the nominee.\nOn policy there is little disagreement. First they still believe in redistribution of wealth (the Robin Hood Theory). The rich are too rich and need to pay more in taxes. The upper limit was not quite the 90%\u00a0 rate in the Eisenhower administration but close (thank you, Bernie Sanders) to certainly a much higher rate for the upper income earners.\nThe middle class is not what it used to be so therefore the government must do something to change all this.\nThe banks and the drug companies and the insurance companies are too big and they are all bad guys so we must regulate them and watch out for them cheating or getting rich.\nWe need more free programs paid for by tax payers. Free public college education for all.\nTo Hillary's credit she didn't buy into this because she doesn't want taxpayers to pay to educate Donald Trump\u2019s kids.\nStill, there was lots of talk about free health care for all and cheap drugs, too.\nWho is going to pay for all this? The rich guys, of course.\nOn immigration, we should just let the 11 million immigrants who are here illegally stay because they've been here a long time.\nSanders , the avowed Socialist, who represents Vermont, the second smallest state in the Union, kept talking about how great Canada is. Maybe that's because Canada just elected a socialist prime minister.\nHe did waffle on guns a little from the Democratic \u00a0position but I am sure that's because nearly every voter in Vermont owns a couple of them.\nThe hardest working guy in the room was John Dickerson, who was the CBS moderator. His biggest task was making sure CBS got its commercial breaks every 10 minutes. About half way through, I confess, I realized that I can't wait for the next \u201cTrump Invitational\u201d as the Republican debates are sometimes called. At least they are not dull!

(REUTERS/Jim Young)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\nHillary Clinton faced tough criticism Saturday night from her Democratic rivals over everything from her Middle East policies to her swaying stance on gun control to her Wall Street ties, at a debate that saw both Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley step up their attacks on the party\u2019s front-runner.\nThe former secretary of state was put on the defensive almost immediately, as she was challenged by her rivals -- and the moderator -- over military interventions she backed in countries now gripped by instability. Vermont Sen. Sanders ripped her support for \u201cregime change.\u201d \u00a0\nBut while the Paris terror attacks the night before shifted the early presidential debate focus to national security, the candidates sparred aggressively in the latter half over domestic issues \u2013 especially financial industry reform and Clinton\u2019s Wall Street support.\nFormer Maryland Gov. O\u2019Malley called her the \u201ccandidate of Wall Street.\u201d\nAsked about her hefty Wall Street-backed speaking fees and donations, Clinton defended her independence in being able to pursue financial industry reform.\n\nBut Sanders shot back, \u201cNot good enough.\u201d\n\u201cLet's not be naive about it. Why \u2026has Wall Street been the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.\u201d\nHe and O\u2019Malley, unlike Clinton, both want to re-instate a Depression-era banking law known as Glass-Steagall \u2013 and they both criticized Clinton\u2019s Wall Street plans as not going far enough.\u00a0\nO\u2019Malley called it \u201cweak tea.\u201d\nIn an eyebrow-raising moment, Clinton countered Sanders\u2019 criticism of her Wall Street donations by saying that as New York senator, she helped \u201crebuild\u201d Wall Street and downtown Manhattan after 9/11.\nClinton was later asked about social media reaction claiming she had invoked 9/11 to justify financial industry donations; Clinton said she\u2019s sorry that anyone had that \u201cimpression.\u201d\nMeanwhile, she said she doesn\u2019t think her rivals\u2019 financial industry plans \u2013 particularly to reinstate the Depression-era law that separated investment and commercial banking \u2013 would get the job done.\n\u201cI'm all about making sure we actually get results,\u201d Clinton said.\nThe debate in Des Moines, Iowa, came in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, which thrust the issues of national security and foreign policy back to the center of the 2016 campaign. The format of the debate \u2013 hosted by CBS News, KCCI-TV and The Des Moines Register -- was changed to focus anew on those issues in the beginning.\nClinton tried to highlight her deep experience in foreign policy issues from the outset.\n\u201cThis election is not only about electing a president. It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief,\u201d she said.\nBut, citing the chaos in the Middle East and North Africa, Clinton\u2019s rivals soon turned to her record as U.S. senator and later as secretary of state to question her judgment in foreign policy matters.\nO\u2019Malley appeared to criticize her support for toppling Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi.\nHe said America\u2019s role is not to roam the world \u201clooking for new dictators to topple.\u201d He said it is also important to understand \u201csecondary and third consequences\u201d that come after removing a \u201csingle dictator.\u201d O\u2019Malley called Libya, Syria and other countries in the region a \u201cmess.\u201d\nClinton defended her support for ousting Qaddafi, saying he was threatening a \u201cgenocide\u201d and America\u2019s European and Arab allies asked for U.S. support. And to O\u2019Malley\u2019s critique, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t think you can paint with a broad brush\u201d in an \u201cincredibly complicated region of the world.\u201d\nSanders, meanwhile, referenced Clinton\u2019s Senate vote for the use of force in Iraq and said the \u201cdisastrous invasion\u201d led \u201cto the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS.\u201d The senator also claimed that \u201cclimate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.\u201d\nClinton again called her Iraq war vote a \u201cmistake,\u201d but disputed that the war is the only driver of modern terrorism.\nShe and O\u2019Malley briefly sparred over America\u2019s role in fighting ISIS. After Clinton said it \u201ccannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential,\u201d O\u2019Malley said, \u201cThis actually is America\u2019s fight,\u201d though not \u201csolely\u201d America\u2019s fight.\nSanders staked out a different position in saying it is the nations in the region that \u201chave to get their hands dirty.\u201d\n\u201cThose Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort,\u201d he said.\nThe candidates declined to categorize the threat itself as \u201cradical Islam.\u201d Asked about that categorization, Clinton said only, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re at war with Islam.\u201d\nAll the candidates on stage condemned the Paris terror attacks and vowed to take on the threat of terror.\n\u201cIt cannot be contained. It must be defeated,\u201d Clinton said of ISIS, appearing to distance herself from President Obama, who hours before the Paris attacks claimed ISIS was \u201ccontained.\u201d\nThe attacks across multiple locations in Paris killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds, officials said. It brought the issue of terrorism to the forefront of both party\u2019s presidential primary races. Ostensibly, it is an area where Clinton enters with the thickest resume \u2013 but also one that could, as the debate showed, prove problematic given her involvement shaping the policies in increasingly unstable nations like Libya and Syria.\nWhile the tragedy hung over the debate, the candidates were able to tackle of range of domestic issues including wages and immigration.\nO\u2019Malley landed virtually the only shot of the night against Republican candidate Donald Trump, a favorite target of the Democrats, by calling him an \u201cimmigrant-bashing carnival barker.\u201d The Democratic candidates generally agree on the call for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the country.\nSanders, meanwhile, continued to advocate for a $15 minimum wage.\nBut the candidates were divided on gun control. While Clinton has tried in the past to cast Sanders as soft on the issue, O\u2019Malley accused Clinton of being \u201con three sides of this.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you ran in 2000, you said we needed federal robust regulations, then in 2008 you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying we don't need those regulations ... and now you\u2019re coming back around here,\u201d he said.\nThe debate was notable in that it saw Sanders and O\u2019Malley taking a more aggressive tone against the front-runner, who seemed to have strengthened her hand since their initial debate.\nSince that debate, two candidates have dropped out, leaving only Sanders and O\u2019Malley. She also made it through a lengthy hearing before the Benghazi congressional committee and saw one of her biggest potential political threats \u2013 a late bid by Vice President Biden \u2013 disappear as the vice president announced he would not run.\nSanders remains Clinton\u2019s biggest challenge, and has stirred an enthusiasm in the Democratic base that Clinton has struggled to evoke. But nationally and in Iowa, she continues to lead him by double digits in the polls.\nStill, the FBI investigation over Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email and server while secretary of state looms over her bid, with the probe said to be expanding. Sanders appeared to give her a pass on the email issue at the first debate by saying he was tired of hearing about the controversy.\nSanders, though, stood by his comments at the second debate Saturday night: \u201cI was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email, I\u2019m still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email. \u2026 Let\u2019s go to the major issues facing America.\u201d\u00a0", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "DEMOCRATIC DEBATE  Clinton hit by rivals over Mideast, Wall Street ties", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/15/democratic-2016-candidates-face-off-for-2nd-debate/", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security", "immigration"], "people": ["Martin O'Malley", "Jim Young", "Hillary Clinton", "Donald Trump", "Muammar Qaddafi", "Bernie Sanders"], "orgs": ["Senate", "Al Qaeda", "FBI"], "election_confidence": 0.9973633621405877, "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-11-15 06:03:37", "org": "fox", "article_id": "e310bbfc28aa65b4735b170dc3b6246a", "date_access": "2015-11-15 07:00:04.156895"},
{"body": "Seeking to shake up the Democratic race and loosen \nHillary Rodham Clinton\n's front-runner status, rivals \nBernie Sanders\n and \nMartin O'Malley\n repeatedly challenged the former secretary of State on Saturday night in a debate where they largely agreed on most issues.\nThe session at \nDrake University\n was originally supposed to focus on the economy, but the terrorist attacks in Paris changed that. The deadly assault, which \nIslamic State\n extremists took responsibility for, set a somber tone; the debate opened with a moment of silence, the candidates standing on stage with their heads bowed, to mark the tragedy.\nThe contest is about \u201cchoosing our next commander in chief,\u201d Clinton pointedly stated in her opening remarks. \u201cAll of the other issues we want to deal with depend on our being secure and strong.\u201d\nThe candidates echoed one another in calling for a war against Islamic extremists, agreeing there was a need for better intelligence, a better use of the country's vast military resources and the need for a closer partnership with U.S. allies, especially in the Middle East.\nSanders, the independent U.S. senator from Vermont, used the discussion to once more bring up Clinton's 2002 vote in favor of the Iraq war when she was a senator, which she has since called a mistake. Noting his opposition at the time when he was a member of the House, Sanders said the invasion \u201cled to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now. I think that was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the modern history of the United States.\u201d\nHillary Rodham Clinton waves as Bernie Sanders, left, and Martin O'Malley prepare before a Democratic presidential primary debate, Saturday, Nov. 14, 2015, in Des Moines, Iowa.\nHillary Rodham Clinton waves as Bernie Sanders, left, and Martin O'Malley prepare before a Democratic presidential primary debate, Saturday, Nov. 14, 2015, in Des Moines, Iowa.\nClinton said the issue of terrorism was far more complicated, pointing out that the United States had been a target long before the invasion, including the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. \u201cWe've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing, and no place more so than in the Middle East,\u201d she said.\nIn light of the horror in Paris, Sanders was asked whether he still believed, as he had earlier stated, that global warming was the greatest threat to national security.\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Sanders replied, suggesting that \u201cclimate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism\u201d \u2014 with the fight over natural resources like water possibly leading to even greater international conflict.\nAsked by moderator John Dickerson of CBS News whether they would use the words \u201cradical Islam\u201d to describe the United States' enemy \u2014 as many Republicans do \u2014 all three Democrats balked.\n\u201cLet's not fall into the trap of thinking all of our Muslim American neighbors in this country are somehow our enemies here,\u201d said former Maryland Gov. O'Malley, suggesting the vast majority of law-abiding Muslims are the \u201cfirst line of defense\u201d against radical elements.\nStrikingly, some of the testiest exchanges of the evening came on issues where the differences among the candidates were largely a matter of degree.\nSanders and O'Malley insisted, for instance, on setting a $15 national minimum wage rather than the $12 that Clinton favors, and suggested her history of taking generous contributions from Wall Street undercut her promises to impose stiffer regulations. \u201cWeak tea,\u201d O'Malley said dismissively.\nClinton repeatedly brushed aside the challenges, saying she shared the same broad goals but would pursue policies that were more pragmatic and more apt to achieve results.\n\u201cI have nothing against the passion my two friends have here for reinstating Glass-Steagall,\u201d she said, when the debate turned to a discussion of the Depression-era bank regulation. \u201cI just don't think it gets the job done.\u201d\nClinton entered the evening in the strongest political position since announcing her candidacy in April, benefiting from an impressive performance at the Democrats' first debate last month and her marathon testimony before lawmakers investigating the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.\nNothing she said or did seemed likely to diminish her commanding status.\nBy contrast, Sanders has lost steam after drawing gargantuan crowds over the summer. He has stalled far behind Clinton in national polls, and has also lost ground in some early-voting states, including Iowa, which casts the first votes of the 2016 contest.\nStepping onto the debate stage, the Vermonter found himself in something of a quandary of his own design. He has long disparaged negative campaigning, boasting he has never run an attack ad in his decades-long political career.\nHe also seemed to conspicuously foreclose one line of attack on Clinton, her controversial use of a private server while secretary of State, declaring in last month's debate that the \u201cAmerican people were sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.\u201d Aides have been pressing Sanders to assume a more combative stance, but asked Saturday night whether he was reconsidering his comment, Sanders emphatically said he was not. \u201cI was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email,\u201d he said. \u201cI am still sick and tired.\u201d\n\u201cWhat I would like for the media now is for us to be talking about why the middle class is disappearing, or we have more people in jail than any other country, or we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe've gotten off of Hillary Clinton's emails, good. Let's go to major issues facing America.\u201d\n\u201cI agree completely,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI couldn't have said it better myself.\u201d\nBut she bridled when Sanders attacked her over her fundraising on Wall Street, suggesting that bankers would not contribute so much money if they did not think they would get something in response. \u201cMaybe they're dumb,\u201d he said. \u201cI don't think so.\u201d\nClinton responded that Sanders was trying to \u201cimpugn [her] integrity\u201d and noted that two hedge-fund billionaires were already running advertisements against her in Iowa.\nThe exchange led to a seeming Clinton stumble, when she referred to her work helping Wall Street recover from the Sept. 11 attacks. \u201cI did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York; that was good for the economy,\u201d Clinton said.\nThe negative reaction on social media was swift, including a Tweet from one critic who was incredulous that Clinton invoked the terrorist attacks in defending her relationship with Wall Street. When the comment was read to her onstage, Clinton said she was sorry if her remark \u2014 quickly seized upon by Republican opponents \u2014 was misconstrued.\nIn another response that may echo later in the campaign, Clinton inadvertently raised the generational issue during a discussion of the protests sweeping college campuses. Republicans have repeatedly portrayed her as a has-been compared with some of their more youthful candidates.\n\u201cI come from the '60s, a long time ago,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a lot of activism on campus. Civil rights activism, antiwar activism, women's rights activism. And I do appreciate the way young people are standing up and speaking out. Obviously, I believe that on a college campus, there should be enough respect so people hear each other.\u201d\nO'Malley has struggled to be anything more than an afterthought in the Clinton-Sanders contest and he repeatedly took after both rivals.\nHe cited his record as Maryland's chief executive, saying, for instance, that while all three support a higher minimum wage, in his state \u201cit was not just a theory \u2026 we did it.\u201d\nThe stage was less crowded than at the Democrats' first debate last month in Las Vegas. Former Sens. \nJim Webb\n of Virginia and \nLincoln Chafee\n of Rhode Island both quit the contest after their poor showings.\nThat opened up the two-hour program for a longer, deeper series of exchanges. But that didn't mean they broke a lot of new substantive ground. Much of the conversation touched on issues they had covered before.\nClinton again attacked Sanders on guns, one of the few areas where she is to the left of the Vermont senator.\n\u201cThere are different records,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI know that Sen. Sanders had a different vote than I did when it came to giving immunity to gun makers and sellers. That was a terrible mistake. It basically gave the gun lobby even more power to intimidate legislators, not just in Washington but across the country.\u201d\nSanders cited his votes for certain gun controls and said he would reconsider the liability issue.\nO'Malley said Clinton had her own consistency problems, arguing she had repeatedly changed her position for political reasons. \u201cThere's a big difference between leading by polls and leading by principle,\u201d he said.\nTo the delight of the partisan crowd, all three candidates positioned themselves as aggressively pro-immigrant.\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is \u2014 and let's say it in our debate because you will never hear it from that immigrant-bashing carnival barker Donald Trump \u2014 the truth of the matter is net immigration from Mexico last year was zero,\u201d O'Malley said in response to weighing immigration reform against the need for border security.\n\u201cWe've been focusing on border security to exclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform,\u201d he said. \u201cOur symbol is the Statue of Liberty; it is not a barbed wire fence.\u201d\nSanders, a self-described democratic socialist, drew one of the biggest laughs of the night from the university audience, during a discussion of taxes.

{"body": "As \nDonald Trump\n and other \nRepublicans\n talked tough on illegal immigration during last week's presidential debate, an exasperated \nJeb Bush\n noted that \nHillary Clinton\n's campaign aides were, right then, exchanging high-fives.\nHe might have added: And Republican leaders in many states, like California, were once again despairing.\nFrom the beginning of the summer of Trump, many Republicans here hoped he would disappear quickly, to limit damage to the party's image. Summer turned to fall, and Trump still dominates the presidential campaign. And so does the subject of illegal immigration, posing a mighty threat.\nHow mighty could be seen in a USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll published last week. It demonstrated again what California sees in every election: The party's positions on immigration and other issues, like gay marriage, have cost Republicans a generation of good will and support. Here, the poll reminded, Republicans are limited mostly to older and white voters, religious voters and residents of inland California.\nThe current brouhaha over illegal immigration is important because new voters will carry their views of the political parties with them for a very long time.\n\"The experiences people have when they enter the political system do stay with them,\" said Jon Cohen, vice president of survey research for SurveyMonkey, the firm that conducted the poll. Political views \"can shift \u2026 but those initial moments are important and do frame how they see things.\"\nRepublican difficulties can be seen in three key areas.\nYoung and minority voters\nThere's substantial overlap in the membership of these groups, and in their reasons for siding with Democrats and the party's candidates.\nAccording to the poll, 36% of voters ages 18 to 29 strongly approve of \nPresident Obama\n. Another 40% approve of him more mildly, meaning three-quarters of young California voters are on Obama's side. Asked whether the country was headed in the right direction, 40% said it was \u2014 not a majority but six points above the percentage for California voters overall.\nAsked whether immigrants strengthened or weakened American society, 7 in 10 of the 18- to 29-year-olds said they represented a strength. (Among those age 65 and older, a slight majority felt the same way.)\nViews among Latino, African American and Asian voters were similar. All told, three-quarters of black voters, almost two-thirds of Latino voters and 70% of Asian voters supported President Obama. By strong majorities, all said immigration was positive for the country. Latino and Asian voters were about as positive about the direction of the country as were young voters.\nThose voters receive a contrary message from the Republican candidates for president. To hear them, the country is falling apart, President Obama is an abject failure and immigration is a threat. (The USC Dornsife/Times poll did not test views on the president's healthcare plan, but polls taken since the measure passed showed that it is broadly popular among minority voters. The GOP presidential candidates regularly scorn it and pledge to repeal it.)\nInterestingly, young Republicans are not that different in some ways from their elders \u2014 their presidential selections were quite similar \u2014 but they, too, have more moderate positions on immigration, gay marriage and other cultural issues.\nThe state's coastal-inland split\nThe traditional California fight is between north and south. The political split is between west and east, coastal and inland.\nTake the Obama support rating: Along the coast, 61% supported him. Inland, only 44% did. Two of the most conservative areas of the state, the Central Valley and Inland Empire, had only a 46% and 34% support rating for him, respectively. In both places, strong opposition was by far the dominant view.\nHere's the problem: The Central Valley represents 19% of the state's voters, and the Inland Empire another 10%. The two largest Democratic areas, Los Angeles County and the Bay Area, make up 44% of the state's voters.\nEven inland, demography is cutting into Republican unanimity. A majority of voters in the Central Valley said that immigrants strengthen this country, and 43% of Inland Empire voters agreed. (Growing Latino voting strength everywhere in the state has pushed many inland Republican members of Congress to support changes in immigration policy opposed by their leaders.)\nReligion, or lack thereof\nReligion has long been a dividing line in politics \u2014 the more common attendance at services, the greater the likelihood of political conservatism. It was true in the new poll as well.\nAbout half of Republican candidate Ben Carson's supporters said they attend church at least once a week, the highest percentage for any candidate. Only 20% of Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton's supporters reported that they attend services at least once a week.\nThe problem for Republicans? There aren't enough Californians who are that religious.\nIn California, 28% said they attend services at least once a week, and 44% said they attend seldom or never. Nationally, 35% were actively religious, while 38% seldom or never attended services.\nRepublicans might be tempted to write off California, but their problem is that trends that started here are spreading. In presidential elections, Nevada and New Mexico have become regularly Democratic and Colorado has turned into a toss-up state because of California-style demographic changes.\nThere would appear to be two solutions: a rapid influx of inland church-goers moving into the state, or a shift by the candidates toward moderation. At this early point of the presidential contest, the odds of the former seem greater than the odds of the latter.\ncathleen.decker@latimes.com\nTwitter: \n@cathleendecker \nFor more on politics, go to\n \nwww.latimes.com/decker\n \nand \nwww.latimes.com/politics\n.", "byline": "", "description": "<p>As Donald Trump and other Republicans talked tough on illegal immigration during last week's presidential debate, an exasperated Jeb Bush noted that Hillary Clinton's campaign aides were, right then, exchanging high-fives.</p> <p>He might have added: And Republican leaders in many states, like California,...</p>", "title": "Three key areas that give Republicans trouble in California", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/la-me-pol-ca-california-politics-poll-20151115-story.html", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Rodham Clinton", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "Ben Carson"], "orgs": ["GOP", "Congress", "Los Angeles County"], "election_confidence": 0.9969839217021564, "authors": [{"author_id": 41997, "fullname": "cathleen decker", "primary_org": "latimes"}], "date_written": "2015-11-15 08:05:00", "org": "latimes", "article_id": "5bf4d8ad78d9540c95882d1c5942fa1e", "date_access": "2015-11-15 08:26:25.829957"},
{"body": "An unsettling yet telling split-screen changed the view of the presidential campaign Saturday night: three Democratic candidates who had come to Iowa to talk about domestic issues found their debate hijacked by a foreign policy crisis dominating the news from a world away.\nAs metaphors for the last two presidencies go, the turnabout was apt: Both \nGeorge W. Bush\n and \nBarack Obama\n came into office with domestic issues prime on their minds, only to have conflicts abroad hobble and frustrate their tenures.\nForeign policy, and specifically her vote for the Iraq War, also frustrated \nHillary Rodham Clinton\n in her unsuccessful run for president in 2008. Not even an ad that year asserting that she was most experienced to take the 3 a.m. crisis call\u2014the implication being that Obama wasn\u2019t\u2014was enough to overcome \nDemocrats\n' embrace of his early opposition to the war.\nAs much as anything, Saturday night's debate in the shocked aftermath of the Paris terrorist attack offered \nClinton\n an opportunity to argue anew that her experience is necessary\u2014and her opponents' is insufficient--for any 3 a.m. call. That allowed her to eclipse her rivals on stage, although in doing so, she may have created vulnerabilities a Republican could exploit next fall.\nAs a former senator and secretary of State, Clinton spoke with fluency about the contradictory puzzle and complicated players in the Middle East, and the tensions there that already have spilled into violence on the European continent. She recounted her experience helping downtown New York recover from the Sept. 11, 2001, attack (weirdly, however, it was in response to a criticism of her closeness with Wall Street donors).\nSeeking to shake up the Democratic race and loosen Hillary Rodham Clinton's front-runner status, rivals Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley repeatedly challenged the former secretary of State on Saturday night in a debate where they largely agreed on most issues.\nThe session at Drake University...\nSeeking to shake up the Democratic race and loosen Hillary Rodham Clinton's front-runner status, rivals Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley repeatedly challenged the former secretary of State on Saturday night in a debate where they largely agreed on most issues.\nThe session at Drake University...\nWhen asked to recount a crisis that had tested her, she dramatically retold the story of advising President Obama to go after Osama bin Laden in 2011 despite concerns by many in the administration that the mission could fail. And, she noted, she offered the advice without consulting anyone, even her husband, former President Bill Clinton.\nIt was that question, more than any other, that demonstrated Clinton\u2019s advantage once the focus turned to foreign policy. By contrast, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley recounted the daily tribulations of a mayor and state executive, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders told of a veterans' bill, one in which he was not successful in achieving his initial goal and had to negotiate a compromise.\nIndeed, discomfort on the part of Sanders and O'Malley was palpable from the start. After a moment of silence for the victims in Paris, the candidates moved to opening statements. Speaking before Clinton, Sanders jumped quickly into his familiar arguments about a \"rigged economy,\" a \"corrupt campaign finance system\" and the need for millions of Americans to stand and say that \"enough is enough.\"\nSpeaking after Clinton, O\u2019Malley averred that the Paris attacks showed the need for \"new thinking, fresh approaches and new leadership.\" But he did not offer any of the first two, and on the third, his mention that he worried about terrorism as a governor only underscored his lack of front-line international experience.\nClinton went right to the point.\n\"We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like \nISIS\n, the barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist, terrorist group,\" she said, adding pointedly: \"This election is not only about electing a president. It's also about choosing our next commander in chief.\"\nClinton did not offer many operational details, apart from working with American allies on a united anti-jihadist front. But neither did her opponents.\nThe Democratic frontrunner undoubtedly would have received a rougher going-over had the debate been against a Republican free to oppose her actions as secretary of State from a perspective 180 degrees opposite hers (and all of the GOP candidates' views are.) Her weakest moment came in a muddled response to an obvious question about President Obama's failure\u2014and hers--to anticipate the powerful rise of the Islamic State militants. That's a point Republicans are sure to hammer.\nClinton seemed intent on carefully navigating her party's shoals. She mildly distanced herself from Obama\u2019s ill-timed assertion\u2014delivered just before the Paris attack\u2014that the Islamic State was contained. \"It cannot be contained, it must be defeated,\" she said.\nBut she immediately moved to calm the left: \"What the president has consistently said--which I agree with--is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS,\" she said, citing the U.S. forces training Arab and Kurdish militaries. \"But this cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.\" She mentioned the limits of American involvement twice.\nThe Democratic counter to Clinton was far more difficult to make, giving the debate performances of Sanders and O'Malley the feel of a collection of pulled punches.\nSanders has ridden a wave of support from the party's liberal left. Flaying Clinton for being insufficiently aggressive against the Islamic State and other terrorist\u00a0groups would have inevitably risked a collision with the anti-interventionist views of his supporters, which by all evidence the senator ardently shares. O'Malley, with no clear path to the nomination besides his generational pitch, was effectively in the same fix.\nNeither candidate, for example, explicitly hit Clinton on one of the most significant events of her tenure as secretary of State, the loss of four Americans at the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya. Republicans have argued that attack would have been prevented by a more aggressive posture.\nThe irony of terrorism and foreign policy overtaking a Democratic debate is that the party's candidates have largely avoided the subject this election cycle.\nRepublicans have brawled over the level of aggression each would apply in the Mideast, with several candidates advocating no-fly zones that would put the country's military in direct conflict with Russian planes operating over Syria. Several also have advocated a sharp rise in American troops overseas.\nBut for Democrats, the subject has been far more fraught. Obama came to office in the aftermath of Bush's intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan and vowed to disentangle America from both fights. He has since disappointed some of his followers by announcing that he would keep at least 5,500 troops in Afghanistan beyond the previously announced 2016 withdrawal. He also said recently that he would send special operations troops to Syria to assist rebels there --language that uncomfortably echoes the beginning of involvements in past military theaters.\nSo for the Democratic candidates there had been no real primary season rationale for a focus on foreign policy. The first Democratic debate stuck to the candidates' nuanced differences on issues like economic policy, healthcare and criminal justice, and their agreements on matters such as changing immigration policy and raising the minimum wage.\nThen Paris exploded in violence.\nWhether terrorism will remain at the forefront of the campaign is impossible to predict, given that nearly a year remains before the election. But if it happens, more detail will be required from both the Democrats and Republicans seeking the White House.\nIronically, as the candidates spoke to a country shaken by the Paris attack and wondering if it could happen here, one question was left unasked Saturday night: If France couldn't find a handful of terrorists in a country of 66 million people, how would the next president find them in a country of 320 million?\ncathleen.decker@latimes.com\nFor political news and analysis, follow me on Twitter: \n@cathleendecker \n.

Eisenhower continued his 2016 Greatest Hits Tour.\nA week after \nDonald Trump\n praised Ike for deporting more than a million Mexicans, Sanders offered him as a model of high tax rates for the rich: \u201cI\u2019m not much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,\u201d he said.\nMost important, however, was the moment that did not occur: Though they were resolute in their condemnation of ISIS, none of the candidates went inflammatory or ballistic.\nTaking place just a day more than 120 people were killed in a series of terrorist attacks in Paris , the debate, which was held in Des Moines and aired on CBS, opened without the now-usual campaign-trail/reality-show pomp and pageantry. Instead, moderator John Dickerson, host of \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d solemnly reminded viewers that open debate is \u201ca symbol of freedom.\u201d\nThen, after a moment of silence, he began asking newly added questions about the U.S. response to ISIS and unrest in the Middle East.\nBut those hoping for burning rhetoric, sweeping resolutions or even clear plans were probably disappointed.\nWhile many of the Republican presidential candidates have made strong statements in the wake of Friday\u2019s horrific attacks \u2014 Donald Trump suggested that an armed French citizenry would have prevented the tragedy, Sen. Ted Cruz called for significant air power and many if not all want to close the U.S. to Syrian refugees \u2014 the Democratic nominees chose to tread more carefully.\nSo carefully that it was difficult to know what any of them do in similar circumstance should she or he become president.\u00a0\nIndeed, during the opening minutes of their second debate, Sanders, Clinton and O\u2019Malley were more explicit in their arguments about what the terrorists should be called \u2014 extreme jihadists rather than Islamic extremists \u2014 than they were about their visions of an American response.\nTo be fair, Dickerson, for reasons of his own, never asked the obvious question \u2014 \u201cWhat do you think the U.S. should do next?\u201d Instead, he called on each of them to critique President Obama\u2019s, and Clinton\u2019s, handling of terrorism in general and ISIS particular. This put Clinton immediately on the defensive and Sanders and O\u2019Malley in the unenviable position of criticizing their party\u2019s president one day after a horrifying international crisis.\nO'Malley called for more \"human intelligence\" and Sanders blamed the rise of terrorism on the Iraq war, which, he pointed out, Clinton had voted for. Clinton quickly reminded everyone that many acts of terrorism, including 9/11, had preceded the war, which she once again admitted was a mistake, and unity returned to the conversation.\nEarly minutes were spent agreeing that the Middle East is complicated, the world is dangerous and the enemy is not Islam, a distinction Clinton thanked George W. Bush for making in the days following 9/11.\nIndeed, until the first commercial break and beyond, the three candidates spent so much time openly agreeing with one another, with minor caveats, that they seemed to have forgotten they were political rivals.\nThat changed when the questions returned to the economy and everyone seemed to feel on firmer ground.\nAs the front-runner, Clinton got the toughest questions and the brunt of the criticism, onstage and off. At one point, Sanders criticized Clinton\u2019s reliance on \u201cWall Street donors\u201d and all that implies. Clinton defended her impugned integrity in a strange and scattershot way by announcing that 60% of her donors were women and that she had stood by Wall Street, and the rest of New York, during and after 9/11.\nIf Dickerson, who was otherwise strong on calling out contradictions and non-answers, let her get away with evoking 9/11 in a discussion of campaign donations, Twitter didn\u2019t. A few minutes later, co-moderator CBS News congressional correspondent Nancy Cordes asked her to respond to one negative response, marking the first use of Twitter as a real-time participant of a debate.\nBut even with a few mild barbs \u2014 O\u2019Malley derided Clinton as having been \u201cAnnie Oakley\u201d before changing her stance on gun control, or Sanders dismissed one of O\u2019Malley\u2019s references to his work as governor of Maryland by saying \u201cBaltimore is not now one of the safest cities in America\" \u2014 the tenor of the remarks leaned more toward conversation than debate.\nSo much so that Clinton felt comfortable enough to laud the similarities she shares with her rivals. \u201cWe have our differences,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they pale compared with what\u2019s happening on the Republican side.\u201d\n\u201cAll of us support funding Planned Parenthood,\u201d she continued. \u201cAll of us believe climate change is real. All of us want equal pay for equal work. They don't believe in any of that.

{"body": "There is plenty of anger swirling around the 2016 presidential campaign. Anger at Washington, disdain for Wall Street, disgust with career politicians. Anger is all the rage, and both parties clearly have candidates that are successfully riding the wave. Neither \nBernie Sanders\n nor \nDonald Trump\n would be where he is without the substantial number of fed-up voters in their parties. Everyone can see that. It's obvious.\nBut loathing doesn't account for the differences we are witnessing between the \nGOP\n and \nDemocratic Party\n nomination fights. Fear does. Or the absence of fear. Although both sides are angry, Republicans are more angry at the Republican Party leadership than they are afraid of Democrats, while Democrats are more afraid of Republicans than they are angry at the Democratic Party leadership. That's why Trump and \nBen Carson\n, extreme outsiders, are dominating on the right while Hillary Rodham Clinton, the consummate insider, is dominating on the left.\nThis relationship isn't new: The extent to which fear of the other side tempers anger at one's own often determines the nominee.\nIn 2004, when I ran Howard Dean's campaign for president, Democrats were seething at the Democratic establishment, which had voted with the GOP to invade Iraq.

He is a 74-year-old grandfather with thick glasses and frequently disheveled white hair. And...\nAs fear of Bush's victory rose, voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, who had been attracted to Howard Dean's progressive politics and willingness to take on the party leadership, moved to John Kerry. Venting, they realized, wasn't as important as nominating someone with a better chance to win.\nThis year, fear within the Democratic Party of a GOP win is off the charts. The GOP has majorities in the House of Representative and the U.S. Senate. For Democrats, losing the presidency in 2016 would be catastrophic. With control of both the executive and legislative branches of government, the GOP would be able to roll back all of the accomplishments of the \nObama\n administration and fill any number of Supreme Court vacancies, guaranteeing a rightward shift in the makeup of the court for a generation.\nBernie Sanders can tap into the very real anger at Wall Street and Washington all he wants, but he's not going anywhere; the party rank and file isn't going to risk the 2016 election by nominating an untested democratic socialist. Fear has a way of making voters put ideological purity aside and rally around the most tested, most viable general election candidate: Hillary Rodham Clinton.\nThe fact that many Republicans are probably snickering at those last few sentences helps explain the starkly different race for the GOP nomination. There is a complete absence of fear within the GOP rank and file right now. Having won the House and the Senate, having taken over most state legislatures, the party feels as if the wind is at its back. Are they sick of Barack Obama? Absolutely. Are they sick of Clinton? Certainly. But they don't fear either one of them. They're convinced that the country could not possibly want another four years with a Democrat in the White House.\nAny fear they had of Clinton was erased by months of pundits proclaiming her collapse, her fumbling response to the private server scandal and Sanders' surprising popularity in early primary states. GOP primary voters' opinion of her was so low they happily bought into the idea of her vulnerability, and still do.\nIt's the absence of fear that is driving Jeb Bush into the ground and holding Marco Rubio, \nJohn Kasich\n and others from gaining any real traction. Why compromise for someone who calls illegal immigration \u201can act of love,\u201d or someone who once supported a path to citizenship, if there is no way you can lose? Why not go with the guy who wants to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants, then let the \u201cgood ones\u201d back in?\nOf course, there's still time for the GOP to get scared straight. As Clinton's strengths become more obvious, and they will, fear within the GOP will rise. Republican primary voters could abandon Trump and Carson for Rubio, Kasich, Christie or even Bush \u2014 just as Democratic primary voters abandoned Dean for Kerry in 2004.\nThe establishment candidates just have to hope that fear will overcome loathing sooner rather than later.\nJoe Trippi is a Democratic strategist and media consultant who ran Howard Dean's campaign for president and was a media advisor to Gov.

{"body": "Are we heading back to the 1960s, when cities and campuses spiraled into chaos and conservatives won elections by demanding law and order? In a period that has seen riots over police conduct in Ferguson, Mo., and Baltimore, attacks on police officers in New York and other cities, and now student protests, it sometimes feels that way.\nLast week, several Republican candidates sounded as if they were reviving the tough justice theme that helped Ronald Reagan and Richard M. Nixon rise to power almost half a century ago. Donald Trump derided university presidents who bow to student demands as \u201cweak, ineffective people,\u201d and said he wouldn't have quit if he had been in charge at the University of Missouri. Ben Carson warned that if society coddles students, \u201cWe will move much further toward anarchy than anybody can imagine.\u201d And Chris Christie said it was all President Obama's fault: \u201cThis is a product of the president's own unwillingness and inability to bring people together.\u201d\nIn another flashback to the 1960s, Democrats lined up on the other side, signaling that their sympathies lay with the students. \u201cIt's time to address structural racism on college campuses,\u201d Bernie Sanders tweeted. Hillary Rodham Clinton sent a similar message through an aide. And White House spokesman Josh Earnest lauded the Missouri students for their \u201ccommitment to fighting hate and intolerance.\u201d Their success, he said, reinforced Obama's view \u201cthat a few people speaking up and speaking out can have a profound impact.\u201d\nThere was an unmistakable echo in that micro-debate of the argument after the 2014 unrest in Ferguson, where the police shooting of an unarmed black teenager prompted weeks of angry demonstrations; and the later debate over Black Lives Matter, the movement to curb law enforcement excesses. In all three cases, there has been an impulse toward polarization, reducing the question to: Which side are you on?\nA few Republicans, notably Christie and Ted Cruz, have charged that BLM is calling for the murder of police officers. (A few demonstrators have done so, but they've been disavowed by the movement's leaders.)\n\u201cThe president encourages this lawlessness,\u201d Christie added last month. (The president has condemned that lawlessness several times, actually, even as he has also condemned excessive police \nviolence.)\nOn the other side, Sanders found himself shouted down by demonstrators when he wasn't emphatic enough in endorsing BLM. (He has made amends since.)\nThe implicit message: You can declare that black lives matter, or that police lives matter \u2014 but you don't have the option of believing both those things.\nExcept \u2014 and here's where things get interesting \u2014 most candidates do believe both those things. If you listen closely and dig beneath the sound bites, you'll find that things have changed since the 20th century, after all.\nA recent\u00a0\npoll\n of college students\u2019 attitudes toward free speech (in general and on campus) is a mixed bag.\nThe survey by McLaughlin & Associates for the William F. Buckley Jr. Program at Yale shows that 87% of respondents agreed with this statement: \u201cThere is educational value in listening to and...\nA recent\u00a0\npoll\n of college students\u2019 attitudes toward free speech (in general and on campus) is a mixed bag.\nThe survey by McLaughlin & Associates for the William F. Buckley Jr. Program at Yale shows that 87% of respondents agreed with this statement: \u201cThere is educational value in listening to and...\nAmong Republicans, I highlighted the more ferocious voices, but others have been more restrained. Even the ones I quoted, Trump, Carson and Christie, aren't campaigning principally on law and order. They've mostly answered questions thrown at them by reporters, whose job includes goading candidates into making headlines.\nMost of the Republican candidates have noticed that crime is down, prisons are overcrowded and the cost of incarcerating nonviolent criminals \u2014 mostly drug offenders \u2014 has become an undue burden. Several have endorsed various brands of criminal justice reform: Rand Paul, most notably, but also Cruz and Christie and Jeb Bush. And one or two have even spoken up to say, in effect, that BLM has a point \u2014 although they don't endorse the group's tactics.\n\u201cThis is a legitimate issue,\u201d Marco Rubio said in August. \u201cIt is a fact that in the African American community around this country there has been, for a number of years now, a growing resentment toward the way law enforcement and the criminal justice system interacts with the community. It is particularly endemic among young African American males \u2026 [who] have a much higher chance of interacting with criminal justice than higher education. We do need to face this. It is a serious problem.\u201d\nRubio won't appreciate the comparison, but that wasn't too far from what Clinton said in April.\n\u201cThere is something profoundly wrong when African American men are still far more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with crimes, and sentenced to longer prison terms than are meted out to their white counterparts,\u201d she said in April. It is also wrong, she added, when \u201cbrave police officers are attacked in the line of duty.\u201d\nDespite those knee-jerk reactions to campus upheavals, most Republicans seem to have left the lock 'em up era behind. And so have Democrats; Clinton's position is a shift from the tough-on-crime stance that helped one Bill Clinton get elected in 1992. (Bill Clinton, for his part, was trying to distance himself from the allegedly soft-on-crime Democrats of the 1960s.)\nIt's rare in an election year that candidates are resisting the temptation to polarize \u2014 but let's give credit where credit is due. Maybe, in this instance, Carson got it right. \u201cWe have people who get in their respective corners and demonize each other, but there's no conversation,\u201d he said recently. \u201cIf you ask people to put on the record what their gripes are and what their solutions are, then perhaps they can see that maybe they are not so far apart.\u201d\ndoyle.mcmanus@latimes.com\nTwitter: \n@doylemcmanus\nFollow the Opinion section on Twitter \n@latimesopinion\n and \nFacebook", "byline": "", "description": "<p>Are we heading back to the 1960s, when cities and campuses spiraled into chaos and conservatives won elections by demanding law and order?

{"body": " For Bernie Sanders, it was a missed opportunity. \nThe second Democratic debate was a high stakes chance for him to blunt Hillary Clinton\u2019s resurgence at one of the more crucial times in the Democratic contest for president.\nBut while Clinton did find herself on the defensive over foreign policy and terrorism, the challenges came largely from the moderators. Sanders failed to deliver in small and large ways at the Democratic presidential debate Saturday that would have either cast positive attention on him or negative attention on her.\nIt\u2019s a dynamic that explains why she\u2019s pulling comfortably ahead of him in the Democratic race and likely to remain there in the critical weeks to come. \nAfter the terrorist attack in Paris hours before, Americans expected to hear about foreign policy and more specifically how the candidates planned to fight the Islamic State which took responsibility for killing more than 100 people. \nBut when Sanders in his opening statement was asked to share his thoughts on the attacks, he uttered a mere two sentences on terrorism \u2013 totaling about 20 seconds \u2013 before quickly switching back to his standard stump speech.\n\u201cI\u2019m running for president because as I go around this nation I talk to a lotta people,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what I hear is people concerned that the economy we have is a rigged economy.\u201d\nThe abrupt switch from terrorism as well as his claim that climate change is the greatest threat to national security seemed out of place as the Paris attacks dominated the world\u2019s attention.\n\nClimate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism. And if we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say you're gonna see countries all over the world...you're gonna see all kinds of international conflict, Bernie Sanders\nSanders\u2019 problems with the debate began even before the candidates walked on stage. His campaign spent hours refuting published reports that aides were angry about changes in the format to reflect the Paris attacks. Clinton supporters flooded social media saying anyone who couldn\u2019t change topics based on world events couldn\u2019t handle being president.\nThe independent senator from Vermont has surprised political observers, even himself, with his popularity in the contest that has translated to large crowds and millions of dollars in contributions. But he needs to do something more if he expects to compete with Clinton for the nomination.\nWith the candidates not debating again for five more weeks, the debate was perhaps his best hope to blunt her rise in the polls. He did provide several strong answers, particularly on reining in Wall Street and ridding politics of unaccountable money. But to get ahead he needed to criticize her, something he and his aides repeatedly say he\u2019s not comfortable with. \nEDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM\nWhen asked if he had any criticism in the way Clinton performed as secretary of state, Sanders spoke vaguely about \u201cregime change,\u201d saying forcing leadership changes in some countries are not always beneficial while he barely mentioned her or explained that she has supported such moves. \nEDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM\nSanders instead found himself agreeing with her more than once.\n\u201cI agree with much of what the secretary said,\u201d he said about terrorism.\n\u201cThe secretary\u2019s obviously right,\u201d he said on her assessment of the Middle East. \nSanders did manage to criticize her more than he did in their first debate in October.\nHe forcefully went after her for voting to authorize the invasion of Iraq in 2003 as a senator, saying it created instability that led to the rise of the Islamic State.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the level of instability that we have now,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the history of the United States.\u201d\nClinton acknowledged once again that she made a mistake on the Iraq war. But she then called on him to acknowledge his mistake on a vote he cast to grant immunity to gun manufacturers and dealers from liability if their firearms are used criminally. \n\nThat was a terrible mistake. It basically gave the gun lobby even more power to intimidate, legislators not just in Washington but across the country, Hillary Clinton.\nHe didn\u2019t and instead delivered a muddled answer. \u201cWe will talk of that bill which I agree with parts, I disagree \u2013 I am certainly absolutely willing to look at that bill and make sure \u2013 and not a form of the bill,\u201d he said.\nEDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM\nHe also failed to focus on what political observers consider one of his best lines of attacks \u2013 accusing Clinton of flipping on policy positions. \nEDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM\nIf all else failed, Sanders could have used the emails.

{"body": " Hillary Clinton talked tough and played defense Saturday at the second Democratic presidential debate, as rivals questioned her record and plans to fight the Islamic State.\nA day after a terrorist attack in Paris, terrorism and foreign policy took center stage in the two-hour debate with questions from the moderator and criticisms from rivals often focusing on her record as secretary of state during President Barack Obama\u2019s first four years in office.\nClinton remains the Democrats\u2019 clear front-runner, but the debate illustrated how she will have to answer for administration policy on terrorism and foreign policy. Clinton last month broke with the White House, urging a no-fly zone in Syria and doing more to help rebels there. But she can\u2019t shed her ties to the administration, and Republicans are hitting her hard on her role.\nThe debate also showed how Clinton retains considerable advantages. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Martin O\u2019Malley, the former governor of Maryland, can\u2019t match her foreign policy experience or command of world politics. Perhaps most important, neither is drawing sharp distinctions with her on anti-terrorist policies.\nHighlights:\nThe three opened with a moment of silence for the victims in Paris, then talked about their approach to the Islamic State terror group.\n\u201cIt cannot be contained. It must be defeated,\u201d Clinton said, a slight jab at Obama who said just before the Paris attacks that ISIS had been contained.\n\u201cBut it cannot be an American fight,\u201dshe added. \u201cThis cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.\u201d\nHer two rivals were more assertive about U.S. leadership.\n\u201cI would disagree with Secretary Clinton,\u201d said O\u2019Malley. \u201cThis actually is America\u2019s fight. It cannot solely be America\u2019s fight. ... America is best when we are actually standing up to evil in this world.\n\u201cTogether, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of ... ISIS,\u201d said Sanders.\nRepublicans complain that Democrats won\u2019t use the words Muslim or Islam in describing terrorists.\nSaturday, the Democratic candidates appeared to rally to the term Jihadi or Jihadist, which derive from the word for a holy war by Muslims.\nClinton Saturday referred to a \u201cradical jihadist ideology.\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re at war with Islam,\u201d she added. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re at war with all Muslims.\u201d\nO\u2019Malley used the term \u201cradical jihadis,\u201d but also warned against labeling terrorists with the broad term of Muslim, saying that would unfairly brand the majority of American Muslims who are needed to help fight back violent extremism.\nSaid Sanders: \u201cI don\u2019t think the term is what\u2019s important.\u201d\nEDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM\nO\u2019Malley proposed allowing 65,000 Syrian refugees into the country, more than the 10,000 proposed by Obama, though he said they need \u201cproper screening.\u201d \nClinton also argued for a higher number, adding \u201cI said we should go to 65, but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine.\u201d\nEDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM\nHillary Clinton: \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re at war with Islam, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re at war with all Muslims.\u201d\nBernie Sanders: \u201cI\u2019m not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,\u201d referring to the 91 percent top income tax rate in the 1950s.\nMartin O\u2019Malley: \u201cYou will never heard this from that immigrant-bashing carnival barker Donald Trump\u201d\nEDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE\nClinton\nClinton had to defend her years as secretary of state. Moderator John Dickerson asked if the Obama administration underestimated the Islamic State threat. Clinton didn\u2019t answer at first, then tried to tie the current crisis to President George W. Bush\u2019s decision to end American involvement in Iraq. Each time she was challenged, Clinton would launch into detailed histories of the region\u2019s turmoil and American involvement. Backers will praise her command of detail; opponents will contend she\u2019s avoiding responsibility for being part of a team that didn\u2019t take the Islamic threat seriously enough.\nSanders \nHe got off to a rocky start. He only briefly touched on the Paris terrorist attacks in his opening remarks before turning to his standard speech assailing income inequality and the corrosive nature of money in politics. Viewers then watched as Clinton and O\u2019Malley devoted their entire opening statement to the attacks. Viewers may also have been puzzled when Sanders said that climate change is the country\u2019s greatest threat and a contributor to the spread of terrorism. He also failed to gain traction out of his criticism that Clinton had voted for the Iraq War that he opposed.\nO\u2019Malley \nO\u2019Malley, who has languished in single digits in the polls, performed ably, holding his own with the former Secretary of State and U.S. senator on foreign and domestic policy, including health care and taxes. How would he pay for his policies? He explained. Can a former governor lead the U.S. in a time of global terror? Yes, he said. But he needed a breakthrough performance to attract new attention and enthusiasm to his campaign and his performance fell short.\nEDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE\nWall Street.

For instance:\nSanders criticized Clinton for her support for the Iraq war, saying the was has led to the current instability in the region. Hillary Clinton voted for authorizing the war in Iraq in 2002, which she has since said she regrets. It became an obstacle for her 2008 presidential campaign.

But for the time being, at least, she may be able to afford it. The first debate, in October, corresponded with a time of stress for her candidacy, besieged by various legal and political investigators and drifting downward in voter-preference polls. But Clinton did so well and struck such a blend of competence and charm in the October debate on CNN that she was widely acknowledged to have rescued her fortunes \u2014 or at least strengthened her hand. This latest debate on CBS News and staged at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, was never likely to have as great an impact. The likely audience was limited. It was staged on a Saturday night, competing with various sports and entertainment programs. This weekend, in particular, it was overshadowed by the tragedy unfolding in Paris, where at least 129 people died in terrorist attacks Friday night. The group known as Islamic State claimed responsibility for the coordinated attacks by teams of gunmen and suicide bombers. The debaters observed a moment of silence for the victims in Paris and devoted the first quarter of the debate to discussing the attacks and the proper response from the U.S. and its allies. All agreed the U.S. had a major, leading role to play in battling the terrorists, but all also agreed that U.S. allies needed to respond with greater commitment as well. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont noted that the struggles in the Middle East amounted to \"a war for the soul of Islam,\" implying it was a contest beyond the power of the U.S. government to resolve. But Sanders also explicitly assigned responsibility for the current turmoil in the Middle East to the administration of George W. Bush, whose invasion of Iraq in 2003 was responsible for \"all this instability,\" he said. Sanders made the point that he had opposed the invasion on the Senate floor, where Clinton had voted in support. Clinton has since called that vote a mistake. But the most difficult part of that first segment of the debate for Clinton came when CBS News debate moderator John Dickerson asked whether her prescriptions for the fight against the group called Islamic State suffered for her association with President Obama, who has been downplaying, or underestimating, the strength of the group. As recently as this week, the president had said the group had been \"contained,\" at least in its territorial ambitions in Iraq and Syria. On this, Clinton distanced herself from the president somewhat, saying she had advised more involvement in the region after the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq \u2014 a shift she said was mandated by the agreement struck with Iraq by the last Bush administration. She had said she warned that \"extremist groups might fill the vacuum.\" Sanders said several times that the Department of Defense budget was already $600 billion and that the U.S. should be hesitant to increase that greatly without knowing what it was expecting to accomplish with more military hardware. A self-described Democratic Socialist, Sanders also contrasted his reliance on small donors with the Clinton campaign's donations from the wealthy of Wall Street: \"Maybe they're stupid about what they're going to get [in return], but I don't think so.\" Clinton then insisted on a chance to respond, because Sanders had \"impugned my integrity.\" That drew an audible sound of anticipation from the crowd, which may not have expected even this degree of confrontation between the candidates after the harmony of the first debate. Clinton then said she had many thousands of donors, most of them not rich, and 60 percent of them women. Although not directly responsive to the Wall Street thrust from Sanders, Clinton's reference to gender prompted applause and cheers from the crowd. This was her best moment of the debate, according to people following the proceedings on social media such as Twitter. Clinton went on to suggest her contributions from Wall Street stemmed from appreciation for all she had done to help the Lower Manhattan financial industry recover from the terror attacks of September 2001. That rationale drew a decidedly mixed response from the audience in the hall and on social media, with many questioning whether it fully explained the generous contributions she still receives from the financial industry more than a dozen years later. \n.@HillaryClinton vehemently offers support for Wall Street as post-911 recovery effort.  Does that fly?\u2014 David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) November 15, 2015\n\n\n\nSanders said Clinton's plan to increase regulation of the financial industry was \"not good enough,\" and he had corroborating support from third-place challenger Martin O'Malley, the former governor of Maryland, who called the Clinton plan \"weak tea.\" The candidates revisited a divide on gun violence, with Sanders saying he was willing to reconsider his past opposition to legislation stripping gun manufacturers of their liability when their products were used in the commission of crimes. O'Malley sided with Clinton on this issue, only moments after favoring Sanders' point of view on banking regulation. But, in general, the candidates were largely in agreement on major issues. They agreed that President Obama had been right to offer a path to citizenship for young people brought to the U.S. illegally while still minor children. \"The symbol of America is the Statue of Liberty,\" said O'Malley, \"not a barbed-wire fence.\" O'Malley also won cheers from the crowd for his reference to \"that immigrant-bashing carnival-barker Donald Trump,\" a reference to the candidate leading most polls among Republican candidates for president. All three candidates supported greater access to a college education, with Sanders saying all public universities and colleges should be tuition-free. Clinton said she did not think taxpayers should pay for Trump's children to go to college, as he is a billionaire. O'Malley noted that he had held the line on tuition increases at state schools when he was a governor. And neither Sanders nor O'Malley took the bait when asked whether Clinton's private e-mail server should have been used for any kind of government business. Sanders in particular refused the chance to criticize her on the issue, saying he was still \"tired of her emails,\" as he had said in the first debate. Dickerson then asked Clinton if there were \"other shoes to drop\" as multiple investigations proceed into her time in office and the activities of her aides. Clinton alluded to her 11 hours of testimony before a House investigative panel last month as an indication to the contrary. Overall, the debate did not seem likely to affect Clinton's standing in the primary field. Despite moments of vulnerability and dubious reaction to her defenses regarding Wall Street contributors, she remained the strong center of the cast on stage. She had 40 percent of the total speaking time, with 35 percent going to Sanders and 25 percent to O'Malley. But as she had arrived at this juncture of the campaign as not only the leader but an increasingly dominant leader, Clinton had little room to improve. Dickerson also invited favorable comparison to his predecessors in the role of debate moderator. His questions were crisp, to the point and frequently challenging \u2014 but without the argumentative tone that has brought criticism from participants in earlier debates on the Republican side.\n", "byline": "", "description": "Former Maryland Gov.

{"body": "AMES, Iowa \u2013 The day after a debate in which Democratic presidential candidates tangled over the causes of Islamic State terrorism but not how to confront it, Hillary Rodham Clinton offered a more forward-looking view of American leadership in response to the threat.\n\n\u201cWe have to be rallying our partners and allies, pulling countries off the sidelines,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said on Sunday. \n\nShe called the Islamic State \u201cthe first Internet-fueled terrorist group,\u201d which will require strong countermeasures to its propaganda and recruitment.\n\nSpeaking at an indoor barbecue lunch hosted by several Iowa counties\u2019 Democratic parties, Mrs. Clinton offered no specifics. But she suggested a more proactive approach than she had in the debate, when she dodged a question about whether the Obama administration had underestimated the Islamic State and seemed to take a fatalistic view of terrorism connected to chaos in the Middle East.  \n\n\u201cAttacking Paris, the city of light, reminds us that there is no middle ground in going after these terrorists,\u2019\u2019 Mrs. Clinton said. She was notably alone in bringing up the Paris attacks. Former Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley of Maryland, who also spoke at the event, focused almost entirely on domestic issues. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was represented by a surrogate, the former Princeton professor Cornel West.     \n\nMrs. Clinton implicitly pressed her claim as the most qualified Democratic candidate for commander in chief, highlighting terrorism at a moment that the campaigns of both parties seem likely to pivot to national security and American leadership in the world. \n\nAlthough many pundits scored Saturday\u2019s debate a draw, with Mr. O\u2019Malley having his best night yet and Mr. Sanders more focused in his responses, a focus group of undecided Democrats in Des Moines, where the debate took place, gave Mrs. Clinton a clear win.  \n\nAll 33 likely caucus-goers in the group thought Mrs. Clinton would be the stronger commander in chief, said Chris Kofinis, a Democratic consultant who conducted the focus group.  \u201cIt was clear that Clinton\u2019s answers on terrorism, and her improved answers on domestic issues, moved undecided Iowans in striking ways,\u2019\u2019 he said.       \n\nMr. Kofinis identified one vulnerability: Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ties to Wall Street, exemplified by an answer to a question about accepting donations from rich bankers that has been widely mocked. \n\nMr. O\u2019Malley echoed the critique on Sunday, dismissing her explanation that she has been flooded with Wall Street donations in gratitude for her help in rebuilding the New York financial district after the terrorist attacks of 2001. \n\nMrs. Clinton \u201csadly invoked 9/11 to try to mask\u2019\u2019 her ties to Wall Street bankers, Mr. O\u2019Malley said on Sunday.    \n\nThe crowd of several hundred largely older Democrats did not respond strongly to Mr. O\u2019Malley\u2019s critiques of Mrs. Clinton, which  included sharper barbs than usual  about her record on guns and immigration.\n\nThe crowd, which swarmed Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton after she spoke, seemed pragmatic with less than three months before the Iowa caucuses and as Mr. Sanders\u2019s summer surge in the state appears to be ebbing.  \u201cPersonally, I like what Sanders and O\u2019Malley have to say,\u2019\u2019 Glenda Eggerling, a retiree, said.  \u201cBut I think Hillary will appeal to more voters, and I would really like to see a Democrat in the White House, because I don\u2019t like Republicans\u2019 platforms.\u2019\u2019\n\nSandra McJimsey, also a retiree, said, \u201cI think Bernie has done a great service to the party,\u201d but she declared herself \u201cenergized to vote for Hillary.\u2019\u2019\n\nDespite their embrace of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s foreign policy experience, Iowa Democrats had no interest in committing ground troops to fight the Islamic State, as several Republican candidates have advocated, or in declaring war, as Jeb Bush suggested on Sunday.\n\nChas Weber, a retiree who recently moved to Ames from Michigan, said the Paris attacks and confronting the Islamic State were \u201cthis week\u2019s hot topic,\u2019\u2019 which he predicted would soon give way to something else.\n\nAn independent who is candidate shopping, Mr. Weber plans to attend a rally for Donald J. Trump later in the week.  But he said he was no fan of Mr. Trump\u2019s call to aggressively bomb the Islamic State and commit ground troops.  \u201cHe\u2019s an extremist with no experience,\u2019\u2019 he said.

Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, said today that Europe should not react by rejecting refugees.\n\nEuropean Union justice and interior ministers will hold a special meeting on the Paris attacks Friday.\n\n\u2022 How is Paris playing in the U.S. presidential campaign?\n\nCandidates for the Democratic nomination, in their debate Saturday night in Des Moines, agreed that America is determined to fight terrorism, dedicated to responsibilities to refugees and devoted to diplomacy.\n\nBut Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont sought to tie the rise of the Islamic State to Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s vote as a senator to authorize the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.\n\nBy contrast, leading Republicans like Donald J. Trump, Ben Carson and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas called on the Obama administration to halt plans to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees next year.\n\nAlthough they broadly agreed that the Paris attacks should be the catalyst for a new military strategy against the Islamic State, most of the Republicans were still tentative about committing more American ground troops to that effort.\n\n\u2022 Who were the victims?\n\nLittle seemed to tie the dead at the six attack sites, except that they were out having fun. And that was the point for the Islamic State militant group, which said that it struck France\u2019s symbols of \u201cperversity.\u201d\n\n\u201cBars, a concert, a great game,\u201d Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy, a French author and philosopher, wrote on Twitter. \u201cThis is the French art of living together that has been targeted.\u201d\n\nSeveral foreigners, including people from Belgium, Britain, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United States, were killed in the attacks.\n\nAn American student from California State University in Long Beach, Nohemi Gonzalez, 23, also died in the Paris attacks. She was spending a semester at the Strate School of Design in Paris.\n\nValentin Ribet, a 26-year-old lawyer, was killed at the Bataclan concert hall during a sold-out show by the American rock band Eagles of Death Metal.\n\nGuillaume B. Decherf, 43, a critic at a French cultural magazine and a father of two, was killed as well. Three employees from Universal Music France also died, as did Nick Alexander, a British citizen who sold merchandise for the band, and Aur\u00e9lie De Peretti, 33.\n\n\u201cYesterday, the victims weren\u2019t journalists or famous. They were civilians,\u201d Maxim Ferron, manager of a Paris tea shop, said on Saturday.\n\nYou can sign up here to get the regular weekday Morning Briefing delivered to your inbox. \n\nFor feedback, contact us at briefing@nytimes.com.", "byline": "VICTORIA SHANNON", "description": "A briefing with the latest information.", "title": "Paris Attacks: What We Know and Don\u2019t Know", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/world/europe/paris-attacks-what-we-know-and-dont-know.html", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Bernie Sanders", "Donald J.

{"body": "Here are the week\u2019s top stories.\n\n1. Military troops patrolled Paris as France and its allies around the world mourned 129 people killed in coordinated assaults on Friday that unfolded over three hours. More than 350 people were wounded, many seriously. The French president blamed the Islamic State, calling the attacks \u201can act of war that was prepared, organized and planned from abroad, with complicity from the inside.\u201d\n\n_______\n\n2. France said three teams carried out the attacks, and ended them by detonating suicide belts. One attacker was identified as a man who used a Syrian passport to enter Europe along with the flow of migrants, another as a French national with a criminal record. Confirmation of the Islamic State\u2019s involvement would mean the group has grown from a regional player in the Syrian conflict into a force waging a global terrorist war in less than two years.\n\n_______\n\n3. World leaders condemned the attacks and many tightened security. President Obama is at the G-20 meeting in Turkey for talks certain to be dominated by the fight against the Islamic State and terrorism in general. The U.S.-led campaign against the group had intensified in recent days in Iraq and Syria, and a bigger push is now likely.\n\n_______\n\n4. A new urgency pulsed through talks on a political solution to Syria\u2019s war. Diplomats from the U.S., France, Russia, Iran and other nations met in Vienna on Saturday, facing knotty divisions on a way forward. Secretary of State John Kerry said the Paris attacks were born of \u201ca kind of medieval and modern fascism at the same time, which has no regard for life, which seeks to destroy and create chaos and disorder and fear.\u201d\n\n_______\n\n5. The second Democratic debate opened with a long discussion of the Paris attacks. Hillary Clinton deftly spun questions that invited her to blame the Obama administration for allowing the rise of the Islamic State, and defended herself from Bernie Sanders\u2019s onslaughts on her relationship with Wall Street. Martin O\u2019Malley may have had the most discussed single line, calling Donald Trump an \u201cimmigrant-bashing carnival barker.\u201d\n\n_______\n\n6. The Republican candidates paused their criticisms of one another, particularly against Marco Rubio\u2019s switch to a hard line on immigration. They broadly agreed that the U.S. should strengthen its military strategy against the Islamic State, and some proposed sending ground troops.\n\n_______\n\n7. Other developments this week were independent of international terrorism. Turmoil over racial discrimination spread to campuses across the country after protests forced top officials at the University of Missouri system to step down. Some students acknowledged they had felt only subtle signs of discrimination. \u201cWhat matters,\u201d one protester said, \u201cis that we all need to have empathy for the experiences that people of color have even if we don\u2019t have those experiences for ourselves.\u201d\n\n_______\n\n8. A Times special report found a thriving U.S. black market that moves guns from states with lax gun laws into those with tougher measures. In New York and New Jersey, which have some of the strictest laws in the country, weapons involved in crimes often arrived via the so-called Iron Pipeline \u2014 Interstate 95 and its tributaries \u2014 from Virginia, Georgia and Florida.\n\n_______\n\n9. The Swiss foundation that holds the copyright to \u201cThe Diary of Anne Frank\u201d has listed her father as a co-author. The diary, by all accounts, remains the words of a young girl hiding from the Nazis with her family. Emphasizing Otto Frank\u2019s contributions of edits and a prologue allows the foundation to extend its copyright from 70 years after her death in 1945 at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp to 70 years after his death in 1980.\n\n_______\n\n10. International sports officials banned Russia from track and field competitions after a report accused Russia of running a state-sponsored doping program. And should the country fail to rapidly demonstrate compliance with anti-doping regulations, the ban could be extended to include the 2016 Olympics in Brazil.\n\n_______\n\n11. President Obama is scheduled to head from the G20 meeting in Turkey to Asia, for a lengthy trip to Malaysia and the Philippines. His agenda will include promoting the Trans-Pacific Partnership and attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting in Manila on Wednesday.\n\n_______\n\nYour Weekend Briefing is published Sundays at 6 a.m. Eastern.\n\nAnd don\u2019t miss Your Morning Briefing, weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Evening Briefing, weeknights at 6 p.m. Eastern.\n\nWant to look back?

{"body": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The tragedy in Paris is roiling American politics, bolstering the Republican right\u2019s anti-immigration demands in the short run and perhaps ultimately enhancing Hillary Rodham Clinton and her credentials as the candidate with experience.\n\nPoliticians from President Obama on down have expressed outrage at the attacks, for which the Islamic State claimed responsibility.\n\nSeveral leading Republicans immediately politicized the issue. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas blamed Mr. Obama and what he called a weak \u201cphoto-op\u201d foreign policy, and one of the party\u2019s presidential front-runners, Donald J. Trump, said the tragedy reinforced the need for \u201ctougher\u201d American leadership.\n\n\u201cThis will be exceptionally important\u201d in shaping the presidential race, said Peter D. Hart, a prominent Democratic poll-taker, suggesting it was likely to help Mrs. Clinton, the only top-tier candidate in either party who has a background in national security.\n\nIn a debate among Democratic candidates on Saturday, she opened by stating that the United States would be electing a new commander in chief.\n\nThe attacks seem certain to heighten the importance of foreign policy in an election where it has not been prominent. In a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, only 8 percent of the public cited terrorism as the most important issue.\n\nThe attacks were immediately seized upon as a reason for cracking down on immigration. \u201cThis will help the anti-immigration cause and hurt efforts to bring in Syrian refugees,\u201d predicted Vin Weber, a leading Republican strategist and immigration advocate.\n\nAmong Republicans, the speculation was about the consequences of the Paris attacks for Mr. Trump. In Iowa on Thursday, he let loose a particularly vicious tirade against some of his rivals.\n\nThere was a growing sense within the Republican establishment that the \u201cTrump rant\u201d might be the incident that really derails his candidacy, even though he has not been affected by supposedly lethal political acts in the past. The terrorist episode could reverse any political slippage. Mr. Trump has largely set the agenda and dominated the dialogue on immigration; other candidates have followed.\n\nBoth prominent Republicans and Democrats suggested that a renewed attention to terrorism could harden his core support, though an overall emphasis on foreign policy would not play to Mr. Trump\u2019s strengths.\n\nAmong the other leading contenders, the boyish-looking Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, 44, has most emphasized a hard line on national security.\n\nYet, Mr. Hart predicts voters \u201cwon\u2019t want the kid\u201d in the White House. Mr. Cruz, though the same age, was seen as projecting more forcefulness than his rivals in his response to the attacks, though he may have overreached.\n\nMr. Weber, one of the Republican wise men, said that with time, voters may look \u201cfor someone with more gravitas.\u201d He said he hoped this would play to the strength of his candidate, former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida.\n\nMr. Bush, considered one of the more mature candidates in either party, has only derivative national security credentials because of his family, particularly his brother, former President George W. Bush. That may prove a mixed blessing for a candidate struggling to regain his footing.\n\nThe reason Mr. Hart sees an advantage for Mrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state, is that a greater focus on terrorism will cause voters to look even more for a \u201cheavy and strong hand at the tiller.\u201d This might minimize the problems she has among staunchly noninterventionist Democratic primary voters because she is more hawkish on foreign policy than the president she served. And it could help her in a general election, though Republicans constantly criticize the \u201cObama/Clinton\u201d weakness on foreign policy.\n\nIn the Democratic debate, Mrs. Clinton took the hardest line on national security: She insisted that the Islamic State \u201cmust be defeated,\u201d not just contained, and stressed that she had advised Mr. Obama to approve the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.\n\nHowever this evolves, both Republicans and Democrats agree that Nov. 13 is likely to be an important marker in the selection of the 45th American president.", "byline": "ALBERT R.

{"body": "DES MOINES \u2014  The news team at station KCCI buzzed with nervous anticipation here at Drake University on Saturday night, less than two hours before the start of the Democratic candidates\u2019 debate.\n\nIt was the first presidential debate that KCCI, the local CBS affiliate, would help present in its 60-year history, and the atmosphere had shifted dramatically in the previous 24 hours \u2014 from one charged with excitement to a grave and somber tone following the deadly terror attacks in Paris.\n\nBehind a temporary stage erected for the event, KCCI\u2019s news director, Dave Busiek, watched a live stream of CBS News coverage on his iPhone about the latest developments out of Paris. In a nearby workspace, the veteran anchor Kevin Cooney made final preparations for the questions he would pose later about national security as one of debate\u2019s four moderators.\n\nJust after 6:15 p.m., cameras flashed on the KCCI anchors Stacey Horst and Steve Karlin, who stood on the stage and welcomed viewers to an area for the news media known as the spin room; they noted how the carnage in Paris would change the focus of the debate.\n\n\u201cOur viewers are interested in that,\u201d Mr. Busiek said. \u201cThat flows into what will be a very serious discussion with who could be the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nBroadcasting from Iowa\u2019s capital city to 434,500 TV households in the country\u2019s 72nd largest television market, KCCI takes on outsize importance among the nation\u2019s local television stations every four years. Iowans are the first in the nation to vote in presidential caucuses, setting the tone for the rest of the campaign season.\n\nAs a result, presidential candidates devote significant face time to KCCI, the perennial market leader and one of 30 stations owned by Hearst, and its rival WHO-HD, the local NBC affiliate. And the stations respond in kind, adding more political coverage to the menu of news offerings.\n\nKCCI started its own Sunday morning half-hour interview program this fall called \u201cClose Up,\u201d which has featured interviews with presidential candidates from both parties. And WHO boasts that it televises 25 percent more news each week than other stations in the market, thanks in large part to a 4 p.m. newscast that presents a more in-depth look at news and politics. WHO also is hosting three special one-hour forums this week featuring the Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Bobby Jindal. The stations also count on campaigns and interest groups to open their checkbooks in the months leading up to the caucuses and the general election. KCCI and its market rivals are likely to reap a disproportionate share of the $3.3 billion in political advertising dollars that analysts project will go to local television stations for 2016 races, particularly for pre-caucus spending.\n\n\u201cTechnically, the presidential election is a national election,\u201d said Elizabeth Wilner, a senior vice president at Kantar Media/CMAG, a company that monitors political advertising. \u201cBut in reality it is a race that occurs in about 10 states. In 2012, seven states saw 84 percent of all local TV ad spend, and we expect that same dynamic again.\u201d\n\nThat swing in political ad spending is of huge importance to the big media conglomerates that own local television stations, particularly as other categories of advertisers shift a larger share of spending to digital outlets. \u201cIn political, TV is still king,\u201d said Kip Cassino, executive vice president for research at Borrell Associates.\n\nOver the last several years, a wave of consolidation has swept across the industry with station owners trying to put themselves in the path of more of political advertising dollars. In 2013, for instance, Tribune Company closed a $2.7 billion acquisition of Local TV Holdings that made it one of the country\u2019s largest station owners; it added stations in 16 markets in the transaction, including WHO in Des Moines.\n\nTribune is now expecting to gross about $200 million in political advertising sales in 2016, up 25 percent from adjusted revenues in 2012. \u201cAt this point, we\u2019re calling for it to be strong, all signs are pointing to that,\u201d Peter Liguori, chief executive of Tribune Media, said during a recent conference call, noting the company\u2019s strength in swing states. In Des Moines, station executives said that the sales strategy boiled down to waiting for the phones to ring and the orders to come in. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to actively go out,\u201d said Dale R. Woods, general manager of WHO. \u201cThey are the ones who want to obtain our real estate.\u201d\n\nAnd while ad orders have started trickling in, executives said that the deluge largely has yet to arrive, partly because of the large number of Republican candidates this year, which has prompted campaigns to hold back on paying for advertising as they wait for the field to narrow. The surprising success of Donald J. Trump, who for the most part does not use advertising, has also affected how the candidates spend.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a decent position,\u201d said Brian Sather, president and general manager of KCCI. \u201cWe\u2019re open for business.\u201d\n\nThe stations also benefit from the rise of outside political action groups. While the stations are required by law to provide equal access to candidates and to charge them the lowest unit rates, there are no laws limiting what they can charge outside groups for commercial time. Analysts project a sharp increase in spending by these groups for 2016.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing stopping stations from charging groups five to six times as much \u2014 or even 10 times as much\u201d as they charge candidates, Ms. Wilner of Kantar said. \u201cNobody weeps for the poor billionaire that has to pay 10 times as much as the candidate.\u201d\n\nBut the influx of campaign dollars creates a delicate situation for the stations, which have to juggle their limited supply of commercial time. High demand for political ads in the Des Moines market, particularly in the weeks leading up to the caucus, can put a squeeze on inventory and push out local businesses, such as car dealerships, that are the bread-and-butter advertisers year round.\n\n\u201cIt is a balancing act,\u201d Mr. Sather said. \u201cWe try to do our best.\u201d\n\nMike Schreurs, chief executive of Strategic America, an advertising agency in West Des Moines, said that it is common for businesses to see as many as one out of four commercial spots bumped from local TV during the peak political season. They also might have to pay at least a 30 percent increase in the rates. \u201cIt takes the inventory away from smaller retailers and advertisers, not including the fact that it creates something of a toxic environment,\u201d he said.Already, more than 35,000 commercials adding up to more than $22.5 million in spending have aired or are scheduled to air on Iowa television stations through Feb. 2, the day after the Iowa caucuses, according to an analysis of Federal Communications Commission records by The Des Moines Register. On KCCI alone, viewers will see more than 62 ads a day in the eight days leading up to the Iowa caucuses. And at WHO, Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s campaign has booked a single spot for $5,800 to air during prime time Monday night. A spot airing during another time the same week cost $60.\n\nBack in the spin room after the debate on Saturday night, KCCI anchors wrapped up more than four hours of related coverage. During the coming 78 days leading to the Iowa caucus, the journalists plan to return to the air to cover the twists and turns of the campaign. But, for the moment, Mr. Karlin, one of the anchors, reflected on the Des Moines station\u2019s moment in the national spotlight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a privilege for a television station like us to be part of a debate like this,\u201d he said.", "byline": "EMILY STEEL", "description": "Over the last several years, a wave of consolidation has swept across the industry with station owners trying to put themselves in the path of more of political advertising dollars.", "title": "Iowa TV Gets Its Close-Up, Enjoying Outsize Influence", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/16/business/media/iowa-tv-gets-its-close-up-enjoying-outsize-influence.html", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Elizabeth Wilner", "Donald Trump", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Donald J.

{"body": "Hillary Clinton should have seen that Wall Street shot coming. Instead, she compounded the damage.\n\nThe former secretary of state was off to a sound outing in Saturday night\u2019s debate against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley of Maryland. Friday\u2019s terrorist attacks in Paris dominated at first, allowing her to highlight her superior experience in world affairs. But it was those attacks that made her badly muffed response to questions about her fealty to Wall Street all the more jarring. Here\u2019s the exchange:\n\nMr. Sanders: \u201cI have never heard a candidate, never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military-industrial complex, not one candidate say, oh, these campaign contributions will not influence me. I\u2019m going to be independent. Well, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something. Everybody knows that. Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate. We are relying on small campaign donors, 750,000 of them, 30 bucks apiece. That\u2019s who I\u2019m indebted to.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton: \u201cWell John, wait a minute. Wait a minute, he has basically used his answer to impugn my integrity. Let\u2019s be frank here.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanders: \u201cNo, I have not.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton: \u201cOh, wait a minute, senator. You know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small. And I\u2019m very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60 percent. So, I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked. Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York. It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.\u201d\n\nPredictably, Twitter exploded with demands to know what campaign donations from big banks had to do with New York\u2019s recovery from 9/11.\n\nAnswer: little to nothing. Since 2001, she and Bill Clinton have earned more than $125 million for speeches, many of the most lucrative made before financial groups.\n\nThat does not begin to account for the millions of dollars given directly to her campaign, and to political action committees backing her. Nearly 15 years after the 2001 attacks, Mrs. Clinton was earning more than $200,000 for a 20-minute speech. Most of those took place behind guarded doors. But one can guess that she and the financial executives were not still talking about 9/11.\n\nMiddle-class Americans associate Wall Street with the 2008 meltdown of the economy that cost so many their homes and savings. In the debate Mrs. Clinton repeatedly referred to her plan for reining in banks, but offered precious few specifics. This is what happens when Hillary Clinton the candidate gets complacent. The debate moderator, John Dickerson, had even tipped her off before a commercial break that the next topic was Wall Street.\n\nHer effort to tug on Americans\u2019 heartstrings instead of explaining her Wall Street ties \u2014 on a day that the scars of 9/11 were exposed anew \u2014 was at best botched rhetoric. At worst it was the type of cynical move that Mrs. Clinton would have condemned in Republicans. She should make a fast, thorough effort to explain herself by providing a detailed plan for how she would promote measures protecting middle-class Americans from another financial crisis.", "byline": "THE EDITORIAL BOARD", "description": "After a good start on national security and terrorism, Hillary Clinton flubbed legitimate questions about her ties to Wall Street on Saturday.", "title": "Hillary Clinton Botches Wall Street Questions", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/16/opinion/hillary-clinton-botches-wall-street-questions.html", "topics": ["economy"], "people": ["Bill Clinton", "Bernie Sanders", "John Dickerson", "Hillary Clinton", "Martin O'Malley"], "orgs": [], "election_confidence": 0.8708710278871227, "authors": [{"author_id": 697, "fullname": "the editorial board", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-11-15 21:26:52", "org": "nyt", "article_id": "ac1a1d01775534781b522dfa3ead3ef1", "date_access": "2015-11-15 21:45:54.898058"},
{"body": "The fight against global terrorism will take center stage Saturday night when Democrats gather in Iowa to debate after the gruesome attacks in Paris that laid bare the kinds of threats the next American president will face.\n\nA month after the Democratic presidential candidates clashed on gun control and financial regulations in their first debate, which focused largely on domestic and economic issues, they are expected to face more questions on foreign policy and national security. Hours after the deadly attacks, CBS News, a co-host of the event, said it would refocus the debate to give candidates an opportunity to discuss how they would respond to such an international crisis.\n\nDespite the tragic nature of the events, the new backdrop represents an opportunity for Hillary Rodham Clinton, the former secretary of state, to shine at a moment when her two remaining rivals, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Martin O\u2019Malley \u2014 neither of whom has much foreign policy experience \u2014 will be under pressure to blunt her momentum.\n\nSince Mrs. Clinton\u2019s crisp debate performance in October, her poll numbers have surged, she weathered hours of congressional questioning about her handling of the Benghazi attacks, and three of her rivals for the nomination have dropped out.\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting to see if Secretary Clinton can keep doing what she\u2019s been doing,\u201d said Brad Anderson, who was President Obama\u2019s 2012 state director in Iowa. \u201cHer steadiness is why you\u2019re seeing her poll numbers continue to increase, especially when you look at what\u2019s happening on the other side of the aisle.\u201d\n\nA New York Times/CBS News survey released this week showed Mrs. Clinton continuing to dominate the race, with more than half of Democratic primary voters backing her and 62 percent thinking she is the candidate who can bring about change in Washington. The shift in the debate\u2019s emphasis to foreign affairs should allow Mrs. Clinton to highlight her deep experience on the international stage, providing an opportunity to extend her advantage.\n\nFor Mrs. Clinton\u2019s opponents, the debate presents a chance to tell voters otherwise, and her Senate votes and handling of international crises as a senator and a diplomat could come under scrutiny.\n\nStill, the event is not expected to resemble the free-for-all atmosphere that has marked Republican debates, which have featured sharp exchanges and personal attacks. While the Republican primary contest is a crowded affair, the Democrats will have considerably more time to make their cases and delve into more detailed policy arguments on Saturday with just three candidates on the stage. Since the last debate, Lincoln Chafee, the former governor of Rhode Island, and former Senator Jim Webb of Virginia have dropped out of the race. Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard professor who was running as a Democrat but was not included in the last debate, also stopped his campaign.\n\nMr. Sanders will get another opportunity to take a harder line against Mrs. Clinton, after he dismissed the controversy surrounding her use of a private email server as secretary of state and largely avoided attacking her directly in their first face-off. He has been preparing sharper lines against Mrs. Clinton on issues like trade, gun control and her emails, and his advisers say he has been studying her record more closely since their October meeting.\n\nDemocratic strategists say the debate will also be a significant moment for Mr. O\u2019Malley, the former governor of Maryland, whose poll numbers lag in the low single digits. Facing Mrs. Clinton\u2019s star power and the grass-roots support behind Mr. Sanders, Mr. O\u2019Malley needs to find a way to capture some of the spotlight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the play that he has left in his playbook right now, to come out swinging and let people know he\u2019s not just this nice guy and that he can be tough,\u201d said Kevin Geiken, a Democratic political consultant for Bluprint Strategies.\n\nStill, it will be a challenge to rattle Mrs. Clinton, who has lurched to the left on issues like trade and the environment while showing a deft ability to repel criticism of her 2002 vote to authorize the Iraq war and her warm relationship with Wall Street.\n\nOne area on the domestic front that is likely to come up is the issue of criminal justice reform, which the three candidates have been struggling to address after continuing tension between the police and African-Americans.\n\nDeRay Mckesson, a leader of the Black Lives Matter movement, said he had a good sense of the plans from Mr. Sanders and Mr. O\u2019Malley, but had not heard a comprehensive proposal on the issue of criminal justice from Mrs. Clinton, despite her meetings with the group.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been eking it out literally one speech at a time,\u201d Mr. McKesson said. \u201cWith Hillary, I only have a surface-level understanding. The debate is a chance to learn what she really thinks about the core issues.\u201d\n\nBut voters will only learn if they tune in. Some political enthusiasts have complained that because of its Saturday night time slot, the two-hour debate, which will be hosted by CBS News and The Des Moines Register and begin at 9 p.m. Eastern time, may not have the audience of previous events that have drawn millions of viewers.\n\nMr. Anderson, the Iowa strategist, noted that the candidates would convene at the same time that the undefeated Iowa Hawkeyes take on the Minnesota Golden Gophers in college football.\n\n\u201cThe majority of Iowans will be planning their day around that football game,\u201d he said.", "byline": "ALAN RAPPEPORT", "description": "The fight against global terrorism will take center stage after attacks in Paris that laid bare the kinds of threats the next American president will face.", "title": "Democratic Debate Has an Unplanned Theme: Terrorism", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/us/politics/democratic-debate-cbs.html", "topics": ["racial issues"], "people": ["Timothy Anderson", "Lawrence Lessig", "Martin O'Malley", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Jim Webb", "Brad Anderson", "Bernie Sanders", "Lincoln Chafee"], "orgs": ["Senate"], "election_confidence": 0.9148687153485446, "authors": [{"author_id": 8381, "fullname": "alan rappeport", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-11-15 00:33:01", "org": "nyt", "article_id": "b770967da0ca9ceede7aa3742385563f", "date_access": "2015-11-15 01:00:52.953328"},

From boos for \u201cgotcha\u201d questions and angry complaints directly from the candidates \u2014 sometimes right on stage \u2014 over debate formats, it\u2019s been a brutal run for some moderators (though a ratings bonanza for the networks).  The ferret-like journalistic questioning of CBS\u2019s John Dickerson, the moderator of Saturday night\u2019s debate and host of \u201cFace the Nation,\" represented something of an honorable mean between the contentiousness of the CNBC anchors at last month\u2019s unruly Republican debate and the cautiousness of Fox Business anchors at this month\u2019s GOP encounter. \nFew people expected many fireworks from Saturday night\u2019s Democratic primary debate. The horror of the attacks in Paris put a somber damper on the evening, dominating the first half of the debate. But moderator Dickerson and his fellow questioners \u2013 CBS News congressional correspondent Nancy Cordes, Iowa\u2019s KCCI-TV anchor Kevin Cooney and Des Moines Register political columnist Kathie Obradovich \u2014 were widely praised for being aggressive but respectful, concentrating on sharpening the exchanges and surfacing underlying tensions between the candidates. \nStory Continued Below\n\u201cYou said Sen. Sanders took a vote on [gun] immunity you don\u2019t like. If he can be tattooed by a single vote and that ruins all future opinions by him on this issue, why then isn\u2019t he right that your vote on Iraq tattoos you forever for your judgment?\" Dickerson asked Hillary Clinton at one point. \nThe question didn\u2019t immediately elicit fireworks, as Clinton quickly responded that her Iraq vote was a mistake, and challenged Bernie Sanders to say the same about his gun vote. But it eventually led to a revealing exchange between the two nonetheless.\nObradovich pushed Sanders on what level of \u201cjob loss\u201d he would consider acceptable in exchange for a higher minimum wage, and after he danced around the answer, she prodded further: \u201cDo you think job losses are a consequence that are worth accepting?\u201d \n\nDebate Night \n\n            By \nEli Stokols\n\nThe first hour was more uneven, as the candidates cautiously parsed their differences on national security in the wake of the Paris attacks. But Dickerson, who led the terrorism discussion, deftly cited aspects of the candidates\u2019 record and past inconsistencies to clarify their positions.\nHe smartly latched onto a 2014 speech from Clinton in which she said she \"could not have predicted the extent to which ISIS could be effective in seizing cities in Iraq.\" \n\"So you've got prescriptions for the future. But how-- how do we know if those prescriptions are any good if you missed it in the past?\u201d Dickerson asked. \n His tone, throughout the night, stayed calm and curious, only rising when it came time to cut candidates\u2019 off for a commercial break.\n\u201cIs the world too dangerous for a governor with no foreign policy experience?\u201d he queried a ruffled Martin O\u2019Malley. \nDickerson's question of the night, destined to become a GOP attack line, got all three candidates to dance around the term \u201cradical Islam,\u201d refusing to characterize the Paris attackers by their religion. \n\"Marco Rubio, also running for president, said that this attack showed in Paris showed that we are at war with radical Islam. Do you agree with that characterization, radical Islam?\u201d Dickerson asked, directing his question first to Clinton. \nThe Saturday evening time slot \u2014 known to be one of the lowest rated nights of the week for television \u2014 made for less engagement on social media than in previous debates. But CBS wisely decided to integrate the debate with Twitter \u2014 the candidates\u2019 Twitter handle names were plastered on each podium \u2014 and used social media to get the candidates to address real-time responses from viewers.\n\n\nOne Twitter comment, highlighted by the moderators, questioned Clinton\u2019s attempt to attribute her large trove of donations from Wall Street to her work rebuilding New York\u2019s business district in the aftermath of the World Trade Center destruction, something many reporters and political watchers were asking themselves. It was one of the toughest questions of the night and generated the most conversation on Twitter. \nThe move to integrate Twitter was widely praised by journalists and political watchers as, finally, the right way to integrate the social media platform.

Yet about a half hour into a debate, the pall cast over the proceedings by the horrendous Paris terror attacks lifted and spirited sparring commenced. \nBernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley, desperate to reverse Clinton\u2019s momentum, pounced on her connections to Wall Street to put her on the stumbling defensive \u2013 exactly as the duo of Barack Obama and John Edwards did to deadly effect in the fall of 2007. But Clinton isn\u2019t nearly as vulnerable this time (mainly because neither of her tormenters is named Obama) and she emerged intact, if not entirely unscathed. \nStory Continued Below\nUnlike Clinton\u2019s nearly flawless first debate a month ago, Saturday night\u2019s skirmish exposed familiar weaknesses \u2013 a tendency to bog down in stultifying technocrat-ese when she\u2019s playing it safe, coupled with a penchant for spouting factually funky weirdnesses using the very same voice of authority she uses when making perfect sense.\nHere are five takeaways:\n1. Wall Street is Hillary Clinton\u2019s golden albatross. When not bogged down in the email saga, Clinton and her staff spent much of the summer trying to head off trouble from the anti-Wall Street, Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic party by producing a comprehensive financial services regulation proposal. It didn\u2019t quite work.\nThe plan, released last month \u2013 which included personal penalties for financial malefactors and imposition of a \u201crisk fee\u201d on big banks \u2013 was generally well received by mainstream liberals like New York Times columnist Paul Krugman. But it did little to assuage progressives who suspect she\u2019s a Potemkin Village sheriff \u2013 with big Wall Street guns like Tom Nides, Larry Summers and Robert Rubin lining up to run her economic team in the White House. \u201cNot good enough,\u201d Sanders said in his most direct attack on Clinton yet. \"Why, over her political career, has Wall Street been the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton? Maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're gonna get, but I don't think so.\u201d\n\nDebate Night \n\n            By \nEli Stokols\n\nThe biggest wedge issue is the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act \u2013 which separated savings and investment banking \u2013 under her husband\u2019s administration 17 years ago. Sanders, Warren and many progressives view the repeal as the single biggest contributor to the reckless activity that led to the 2008 financial collapse. But Clinton opposes the repeal \u2013 even though it undercuts the central argument of her candidacy, that she\u2019s an indefatigable fighter for working-class Americans.\n2. Hillary said something really cray-cray. The pressure of the dual Sanders-O\u2019Malley attack on Clinton\u2019s Wall Street connections prompted her to say one of the craziest things she\u2019s uttered in public during this campaign or any other. When Sanders acidly pointed out that Clinton has raked in millions from the wealthy executives at Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, she riposted with a clever reference to gender politics: \u201cYou know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small, and I'm very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60%.\u201d\nCool. But things got weird. Even though Bill Clinton had close ties to Wall Street (his Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin would go on to become head of Citigroup) and financial sector\u2019s donors ponied up plenty of cash for her 2000 New York Senate run, she claimed that the main reason bankers have flocked to her cause is \u2013 wait for it \u2013 because of the September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center. \u201cSo I\u2014 I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked,\u201d she said, as the moderators from CBS gaped, gob-smacked. \u201cWhere were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York. It was good for the economy, and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.\u201d\nNeedless to say, the remark \u2013 delivered in her emphatic shout-voice -- raised eyebrows 24 hours after the terror attacks in Paris killed more than 120 people. And it\u2019s not likely to go away. A cascade of obligatory, outraged piling-on ensued: \u201c@HillaryClinton, you reached a new low tonight by using 9/11 to defend your campaign donations,\u201d Tweeted RNC Chairman Reince Priebus.\n3. Martin O\u2019Malley sort of won. It doesn\u2019t matter. When Clinton worked the rope line at her post debate party, a supporter shouted \u201cGive' em hell, Hill!\u201d according to CNN\u2019s Dan Merica \u2013 but it was really the poll-challenged O\u2019Malley who wielded the pitchfork. Languishing at 5 percent in the polls, O\u2019Malley has often found himself crushed between Clinton\u2019s mainstream support and Sanders hoarse populism, too marginal to attract her support, too polished to garner his. But he\u2019s found his voice, besting both during an energetic speech at the Jefferson-Jackson dinner a couple of weeks ago, and he was a confident and confrontational presence on the stage in Des Moines on Saturday \u2013 thwacking Sanders on gun rights and Clinton on banks.\n\n\n\n            By \nNahal Toosi\n\nHis best moment: When Clinton and Sanders were dryly discussing approaches to destroying ISIS, O\u2019Malley \u2013 reflecting the views of a deeply dove-ish Democratic base \u2013 offered an anecdote from the trail. O\u2019Malley told the story of a U.S. service member\u2019s mother who told him not use the term \"boots on the ground\" because, she told him, \u201cmy son is not a pair of boots on the ground.\u201d\n4. Bernie Sanders was bad on Paris. Sanders is an idiosyncratic candidate whose idea of orthodoxy is doing whatever the hell he wants to do. That\u2019s his big selling point as an outsider, but there are reasons why politicians play by a specific set of rules. As my colleague Annie Karni reported, Sanders staff wrangled with debate sponsors to keep his 90-second general opening statement from being replaced by each candidate\u2019s response to the killings in France. That elicited criticism from some fellow Democrats, including some Obama campaign veterans, but Sanders seemed intent not to let the crisis serial him from his core economic inequality message.\nClinton and O\u2019Malley devoted their entire monologues to the crisis, but Sanders offered about 20 seconds \u2013 two sentences \u2013 to express his shock and disgust before plowing into his planned speech. His transition was beyond awkward: \u201cThis country will rid our planet of this marvelous organization called ISIS. I'm running for president because as I go around this nation I talk to a lotta people. And what I hear is people concerned that the economy we have is a rigged economy.\u201d\n5. Emails? What emails? The Department of Justice \u2013 which seems to be widening its probe of the \u201chomebrew\u201d email server Clinton used at the State Department \u2013 may ultimately have the last word. But the debate\u2019s moderators, O\u2019Malley and Sanders were content to make the issue a non-issue. There was a grand total of one question on the topic, and Sanders \u2013 who garnered headlines simply by telling the Wall Street Journal that the DOJ probe was appropriate \u2013 reiterated his disinterest in Clinton\u2019s damn emails.\n\u201cThat's just media fluff. I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email. I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email.\u201d\nGlenn Thrush is POLITICO's chief political correspondent. \n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Clinton shows vulnerabilities, Sanders sounds tone-deaf and O'Malley lives to fight another day.", "title": "Five takeaways from the Democratic debate", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/2016-democratic-debate-takeaways-215900", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Larry Summers", "Paul Krugman", "Jesse Rifkin", "Henry C.

And we need to begin to take this seriously. These are individuals motivated by their faith.\"\n\nOff Message\n\n            By \nGlenn Thrush\n\n\u201cOf course, not all Muslims are not members of violent jihadist groups,\u201d Rubio added. \u201cBut there is a global jihadist movement in the world, motivated by their interpretation of Islam, in this case Sunni Islam, in the case of ISIS, and it needs to be confronted for what it is. This is not a geopolitical movement. It\u2019s a religiously oriented movement.\u201d \nAsked what he\u2019d do if he were president, Rubio called for stepping up support for the Kurds, whom he called \u201cthe best fighters on the ground.\u201d He also said he favored an \u201cincreased number of special operations attacks,\u201d targeting leaders of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. \nBut he did not endorse sending 10,000 U.S. troops to Syria, as his GOP presidential rival, South Carolina Sen. Lindsay Graham, has, saying it was \u201cpremature\u201d to discuss the exact number of troops needed.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Rubio sees a &apos;clash of civilizations&apos;", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/marco-rubio-paris-attacks-isil-215905", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["George Stephanopoulos", "Jesse Rifkin", "Henry C.

But the real target of their barbs was each other, as nearly every GOP candidate stressed their conservative bona fides on a topic that has fired up voters, powered the rise of Donald Trump and hobbled Jeb Bush's strategy of being willing to \"lose the primary to win the general.\"\nStory Continued Below\nAt the Sunshine Summit Republican gathering here, Chris Christie, Rand Paul and Bobby Jindal all tied the attacks to immigration on Saturday and raised the prospect that agents of ISIL had slipped into the United States already or could do so if the administration proceeds with plans to allow in Syrian refugees. On the campaign trail in Texas and South Carolina, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz did the same.\n\u201cPresident Obama and Hillary Clinton\u2019s idea that we should bring tens of thousands of Syrian Muslim refugees to America: it is nothing less than lunacy,\u201d Cruz told Fox News from the site of his campaign\u2019s \u201crally for religious liberty\u201d in Greenville.\nAt a rally in Beaumont, Texas, Trump \u2014 who expressed support for taking in Syrian refugees in September but later reversed himself \u2014 called the administration\u2019s plan to admit thousands of them \u201cinsane.\u201d\n\n\n\n            By \nNahal Toosi\n\n\u201cOur president wants to take in 250,000 from Syria,\u201d said Trump, inflating the actual figure, which is 10,000. \u201cWe all have heart, and we all want people taken care of and all that, but some of them are going to have problems, big problems.\u201d\nChristie rewrote his entire speech at the Republican Party of Florida\u2019s Sunshine Summit in response to the attacks, beginning with his account of the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, when he lost contact with his wife Mary Pat for five hours as she evacuated her office at the World Trade Center in New York.\nHe said that the federal government\u2019s failure to secure America\u2019s borders had left the country vulnerable to terrorist infiltration. \u201cOn an afternoon like this afternoon we wouldn\u2019t be worried about ISIS slipping across our borders to commit unspeakable acts of violence\u201d if the government had addressed the issue, he said.\nNoting that French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande had ordered the emergency closure of France\u2019s borders in the immediate aftermath of Friday\u2019s attacks, Jindal suggested the United States should follow his lead. \u201cIt\u2019s time for us here in America to secure our borders and keep us safe as well from these radical evil terrorists,\u201d said the Louisiana governor.\nEarlier at the summit, at a Friday evening post-speech press conference as the attacks were still unfolding, Carson said he opposed the admission of Syrian refugees into the country. If the administration does proceed with its plan to admit the refugees, Carson said, Islamic State leaders would be stupid not to try to plant terrorists among them. \u201cThat would almost be malpractice, you know?\u201d\nIn his speech at the summit, Paul targeted his Republican rival Marco Rubio as he addressed border security in light of the attacks.\n\u201cI think one of the lessons we should learn from the tragedy in Paris is that we have to be very careful, and very cautious \u2014 extraordinarily cautious \u2014 about who comes to visit, who immigrates here and who studies here,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n            By \nGabriel Debenedetti\n\nHe recounted the story of two Iraqi refugees who immigrated to his hometown of Bowling Green, Kentucky, and were later arrested for arranging to buy to surface-to-air missiles, saying that federal authorities do not do enough to screen out potential terrorists before allowing them into the country. \u201cWho in the hell is in charge of scrutinizing these people?\u201d he asked.\nPaul said he had attempted to strengthen border security by offering a \u201ctrust but verify\u201d amendment to the 2013 \u201cGang of Eight\u201d immigration bill that would have mandated an improved visa tracking system and greater congressional oversight of border policing.\nHe said that Rubio and Sen. Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, struck a \u201csecret\u201d deal to thwart conservative amendments to the bill. Paul\u2019s amendment was defeated and the bill itself died in the House.\n\u201cI don't know what Senator Paul is talking about,\u201d responded Rubio spokesman Alex Conant. \u201cIt would appear Senator Paul is trying to change the subject away from his dangerous isolationist agenda and proposals to cut defense spending. \u2026 Marco has been warning for months that ISIS terrorists could hide among refugees.\u201d\nNot all Republicans were ready to make political points in the immediate aftermath of the attack. The Republican opposition research group America Rising called off its rapid response to Hillary Clinton during Saturday night\u2019s Democratic debate because of its proximity to the attacks.\nAsked at the summit about the Obama administration\u2019s policies and the attacks, Florida Lieutenant Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera, a Republican Senate candidate, took a pass, saying, \"It's all in poor taste today to be laying blame.\u201d\nMarc Caputo contributed to this report.\n\nBen Schreckinger is a reporter for Politico.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Trump, Cruz and others say their rhetoric on border security and Syrian refugees has been vindicated.", "title": "GOP candidates link Paris attacks to immigration", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/paris-attacks-republicans-immigration-trump-cruz-215895", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Francois Hollande", "Alex Conant", "Jesse Rifkin", "Henry C.

Purdum\n\n\n            By \nKatie Glueck\n\n11/14/15 10:33 PM EST\n\n                    Updated 11/14/15 11:21 PM EST\nThe terrorist attacks in Paris cast a pall over Saturday night's second Democratic debate, but that didn't stop the three Democratic presidential candidates onstage from engaging in tense and at times heated exchanges over foreign policy, gun control and Wall Street.\nHere are the eight biggest moments from the Democratic debate, hosted by CBS News:\nStory Continued Below\n1. Clinton distances herself from Obama.Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state in the Obama administration, wasted no time contrasting with her former boss when asked about confronting Islamic State in the wake of Friday\u2019s attacks in Paris. \u201cISIS cannot be contained, it must be defeated,\u201d she said.\nOn Thursday, before the attacks in France, President Barack Obama said of ISIS, \u201cfrom the start, our goal has been first to contain, and we have contained them.\u201d \nClinton\u2019s tough assertion was an attempt to create some distance from that statement, as was her effort to remind viewers that early on, she supported finding ways to \u201ctrain and equip\u201d moderates in Syria, another break with some in the administration.\n2. Jihadists? Yes. Radical Islamists? No.Clinton was pressed on whether she would agree with the notion, held by many Republicans, that the United States is at war with \u201cradical Islam.\u201d But she appeared uncomfortable using that term, a dynamic on which Republicans on social media were quick to pounce.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re at war with Islam, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re at war with all Muslims, I think we\u2019re at war with jihadists,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2026You can talk about Islamists who clearly are also jihadists.\u201d\nShe went on to urge outreach to Muslim countries, and to praise former President George W. Bush for stressing, in the days following the September 11, 2001, that the U.S. is \"not at war\" with Islam.\nRepublican 2016 contenders were quick to pounce on Twitter. For example, Mike Huckabee tweeted: \"You're all grown up now. You can do it. Three words. Ten syllables. Say it with me: 'Radical Islamic terrorism.'\"\n3. Clinton takes heat over Wall Street support.Both Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley tore into Clinton over the support she enjoys from Wall Street donors. Her explanation\u2014that she has a record of pushing reforms on financial institutions, and has a tough plan to further rein in Wall Street, so her donors know what they\u2019re getting into\u2014is \u201cnot good enough,\u201d Sanders said.\n\u201cWhy, over her political career, has Wall Street been\u2026the major campaign contributor\u201d to Clinton, Sanders asked. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re dumb, they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to get, but I don\u2019t think so.\u201d \nClinton suggested that part of her support from Wall Street goes back to the work she did as a U.S. senator from New York in the wake of Sept. 11, which directly affected Manhattan\u2019s financial district. The comment was quickly criticized by Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\u201c@HillaryClinton, you reached a new low tonight by using 9/11 to defend your campaign donations. #DemDebate,\u201d tweeted Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. \nO'Malley deputy campaign manager Lis Smith suggested she was personally offended by the suggestion. \"My dad worked in [World Trade Center] from the day it was built to the day it went down. @HillaryClinton, never invoke 9/11 to justify your Wall St positions,\" she tweeted. \n4. Sanders under attack on guns.Sanders was next up to feel the pressure, as both Clinton and O'Malley criticized him over his relatively conservative record on gun control. In one of the better moments for Clinton, the front-runner went after the Vermont senator for his position on gun control, forcing him to review his record over and over again.\n\u201cI know that Sen. Sanders had a different vote than I did when it came to giving immunity to gunmakers and sellers,\u201d she said. Adding that that decision made the \u201cgun lobby\u201d more powerful, she added, \u201cThat was a terrible mistake,\u201d and said that she would \u201clove\u201d to see Sanders join with some of her former Senate colleagues to reverse that decision.\nSanders, trying to defuse the moment, said at one point in the exchange, \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any disagreement here.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes there is,\u201d interjected O\u2019Malley, who also sought to denigrate Clinton\u2019s record on gun control, saying that when she last ran for president she portrayed herself as \u201cAnnie Oakley,\u201d and accused her of being on \u201cthree sides of this\u201d issue.\n5. O'Malley has a moment--thanks to Donald Trump.Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who badly trails Clinton and Sanders in the polls, enjoyed several strong moments in the debate. His first big turn in the spotlight came when he criticized Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump over his hardline approach to illegal immigration.\n\"Let's say it in our debate because you'll never hear it from that immigrant-bashing carnival barker Donald Trump,\" he said, as Clinton smiled approvingly and the crowd cheered.\nHe went on to urge a more compassionate approach to immigration reform.\n6. Sanders is still \u201csick\" of hearing about Clinton\u2019s emails.In the first Democratic debate, Sanders effectively shut down discussion of Clinton\u2019s email practices while at the State Department by saying he was sick and tired of hearing about her \u201cdamn emails\u201d\u2014and he made clear Saturday that that remains the case, despite a recent Wall Street Journal interview he gave, suggesting that there might be \u201cvalid questions\u201d remaining. \n\u201cThat\u2019s just media stuff,\u201d he said on Saturday. \u201cI was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email. I still am sick and tired of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email.\u201d\nThe crowd cheered.\nLater in the evening, Clinton aimed to push back again on email scrutiny, which has brought with it questions about whether those that went through her private account contained classified information. During the raid that ultimately killed Osama bin Laden, Clinton said onstage, she didn\u2019t even tell her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who instead found out about it from Obama. It was an understated attempt at a reminder that she can be trusted with serious and confidential matters.\n7. Clinton: Enough about me, let\u2019s talk about youAfter a debate that zeroed in on Clinton\u2019s ties to Wall Street and hawkish foreign policy record, Clinton sought to broaden the focus with her closing statement.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve all heard a lot about me in this debate,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to keep talking and thinking about all of you.\u201d\nShe went on to promise to \u201cwork my heart out\u201d and to say that \u201cI need your help\u201d as she ticked through her career, which, she said, has always been dedicated to helping others.\n8. Clinton subtly references her bid to make history.\u201cUltimately I think the president\u2019s job is to do everything possible, everything that she can do, to lift up the people of this country, starting with our children and moving forward,\u201d she said to applause in her closing statement.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "The 8 key moments in the Democratic debate", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/2016-democratic-debate-explosive-moments-215870", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Jesse Rifkin", "Henry C.

{"body": "\nWar Room\n\n                         The Paris attacks have reawakened martial feelings absent since 9/11.\n\n            By \nMichael Hirsh\n\nNovember 14, 2015\n\n                Getty\nRemember the mood in America just after 9/11? The surge of super-patriotism (dare we say jingoism)? The pall of political correctness (you\u2019re fired, Bill Maher). The phrases that so resonated: \u201cLet\u2019s roll.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re either with us or against us.\u201d \u201cBring \u2018em on.\u201d Something like that is taking hold in France right now after Friday night\u2019s horror, one of the worst terrorist attacks on Western soil since that terrible day 14 years ago. \nYou could see it in the grim visage of Francois Hollande, socialist-turned-avenger, when the French president declared, \u201cThis is an act of war,\u201d pledged a \u201cruthless\u201d response, and called in effect for a global counterattack against the Islamic State. The frighteningly coordinated attacks that left more than 120 people dead in the heart of one of the world\u2019s most cosmopolitan and beloved cities were, Hollande said, \u201can act committed by a terrorist army, Daesh, against France, our values, who we are, a free country that speaks to the entire planet.\u201d\nStory Continued Below\nHollande is likely to get a great deal of such support. Because in one night of slaughter, the attacks in Paris have caused the tectonic plates of geopolitics to shift sharply rightward, and no one will be unaffected. The new axis of opinion in the U.S. and Western European countries is plainly going to be harsher, more interventionist and less tolerant of, well, tolerance. Americans were already beginning to lose their post-Iraq war squeamishness about intervening overseas: a November Quinnipiac University poll found that American voters, by a 54-38 percent margin, backed sending U.S. troops to fight the Islamic State in Iraq. It\u2019s safe to assume we\u2019re about to grow more even more interventionist in mood, and Obama, as is his wont, may well follow the public temper, stepping up the minimalist approach he\u2019s taken to countering Islamic State in Iraq and Syria so far.\nAlready in Washington a somewhat more subdued version of this martial mood \u2014subdued only because it didn\u2019t happen here this time\u2014is hardening up the 2016 presidential race. Republicans suddenly possess a new attack line against Obama over his withdrawal from Iraq and reluctance to intervene more dramatically in Syria. Obama\u2019s former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton--who is suddenly on the defensive about something other than Benghazi (though we\u2019ll be hearing more about that too)\u2014will feel compelled to remind everyone at Saturday night\u2019s Democratic debate that she was more hawkish than the president on that particular point.\nThe GOP presidential candidates, of course, immediately seized on Obama\u2019s unfortunately timed declaration in an interview Thursday that \u201cwe have contained\u201d the Islamic State. Donald Trump, never one for political niceties, tweeted: \"President Obama said 'ISIL continues to shrink' in an interview just hours before the horrible attack in Paris. He is just so bad! CHANGE.\"\nTed Cruz, meanwhile, made fun of Obama\u2019s reluctance to blame Islam for repeated acts of terrorism, saying, \"We must immediately recognize that our enemy is not \u2018violent extremism.\u2019 It is the radical Islamism that has declared jihad against the West.\" He also embraced his own brand of ruthlessness, suggesting it was time to stop worrying about bombing civilians, whom Islamic State radicals have been hiding behind in cities such as Mosul. The Islamic State, he said, \u201cwill not be deterred by targeted airstrikes with zero tolerance for civilian casualties, when the terrorists have such utter disregard for innocent life.\u201d Marco Rubio, already building a reputation for himself as the GOP field\u2019s chief hawk, called for \u201cimprov[ing] our defenses, destroy[ing] terrorist networks, and depriv[ing] them of the space from which to operate.\u201d\nThis new right-wing normal will also no doubt seal the fate of less hawkish candidates\u2014in particular the already-fading Rand Paul, whom Rubio denounced at the last debate as a \u201ccommitted isolationist\u201d and who can no doubt hear the tolling of political oblivion even now.\n***\nThe tenor of diplomacy will change as well, starting today in Vienna, where talks were already underway on whether the U.S., Europeans and Russians could find common ground against Islamic State at a time when they were still sharply divided over Moscow\u2019s contention that Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad should be shored up; that common ground is far more visible than it was a day ago. Against the brazen brutality of the Islamic State, even the barrel-bombing Assad will become slightly more tolerable, at least on an interim basis (delighting Vladimir Putin). Old differences seemed forgotten as Secretary of State John Kerry appeared at a news conference on Saturday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and declared: \u201cWe are in absolute and total agreement that these kinds of attacks are the most vile, horrendous, outrageous, unacceptable acts on the planet.\u201d\nCivil liberties, which made a comeback with the Snowden revelations of 2012, will also now fade once again as an international issue. France and Belgium were already discussing increasing their internet surveillance, long a fraught topic under European law; now they\u2019ll talk a lot louder about it.\n\nMichael Hirsh is national editor for Politico Magazine.\nWHAT WORKS\nPolitics\n\n                    By \n                            Jason Zengerle\n\nThe Big Idea\n\n                    By \n                            POLITICO Magazine\n\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "The Paris attacks have reawakened martial feelings absent since 9/11.", "title": "On Terror, We&#8217;re All Right-wingers Now", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/11/on-terror-were-all-right-wingers-now-213358", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "John Kerry", "Michael Hirsh", "Vladimir Putin", "Francois Hollande", "Hillary Clinton", "Donald Trump", "Marco Rubio", "Bill Maher", "Jason Zengerle", "Edward Snowden", "Sergei Lavrov", "Ted Cruz"], "orgs": ["GOP", "Quinnipiac University"], "election_confidence": 0.9200056773482217, "authors": [{"author_id": 32346, "fullname": "michael hirsh", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-11-14 21:02:49", "org": "politico", "article_id": "ce82185674b7e06375be40131f60912f", "date_access": "2015-11-15 02:42:55.006483"},

Purdum\n\nBernie Sanders had the weakest night of the three Democrats onstage at Saturday night\u2019s debate. \nThat\u2019s according to a survey of the POLITICO Caucus, a bipartisan group of influential strategists, operatives and activists in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, who weighed in immediately following the second Democratic primary debate.\nStory Continued Below\nNearly half of Democrats surveyed said the Vermont senator lost the debate, and only 10 percent of Democrats said he won. Those insiders who said Sanders had the worst night argued that he appeared out of his depth on foreign policy a day after terrorist attacks rocked France. He spent just a few seconds addressing the matter in his opening statement before pivoting to his familiar pitch about the economy, in stark contrast to rival Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state who devoted her entire statement to the Paris attacks.\n\u201cHe made a mistake right off the bat in switching from Paris to the economy, and had an uneven performance,\u201d a New Hampshire Democrat said.\n\"He was clearly not comfortable discussing detail on foreign policy matters,\" agreed another New Hampshire Democrat.\nOthers said the self-described democratic socialist made no effort to appeal to the broader Democratic Party, and reinforced perceptions Saturday night that he is unelectable.\n\u201cFocused entirely on his base which demands the pure,\" said an unaligned Iowa Democrat. \"Worst answer: Asked directly how he would work with a GOP Congress, he argued that the Political Revolution would sweep aside all in its path.\u201d\n\u201cThe early primaries and caucuses are getting closer and closer, and he is failing to come across as viable and presidential to pick up the new supporters he needs,\u201d said a Nevada Democrat, who instead thought Martin O\u2019Malley won. \u201cTime is running out.\u201d\nAgreed a New Hampshire Democrat, \"Sanders showed he is just too out of step with middle America to be President.\"\nSeventy-seven percent of Democratic insiders surveyed called Clinton the winner, saying that of the three candidates on the stage, she showed the most presidential stature.\n\"It was a very good night for O'Malley but Secretary Clinton still proved that she is the most prepared to be POTUS,\" said an unaligned South Carolina Democrat.\nAdded a New Hampshire Democrat, \u201cNot even close; Hillary Clinton, once again, demonstrated her mastery of all issues both foreign and domestic; she was truly presidential. Sen. Sanders and Gov. O'Malley are both fine men, but their issue knowledge stops at the water's edge.\u201d\nO\u2019Malley, who took direct aim at Clinton over her ties to Wall Street and her record on gun control, lags badly in the polls, but insiders said he had a slightly better night than Sanders did, with 13 percent naming him the winner and 41 percent saying he had the worst night.\n\u201cO'Malley showed he deserved to be in that stage and should be taken seriously,\u201d a New Hampshire Democrat said.\nAgreed a New Hampshire Republican, \u201cHow could Bernie say climate change was a bigger threat than terrorism given last night? How could Hillary invoke 9/11 as a reason for accepting contributions from Wall Street? O'Malley seemed to be the only one that didn't have a tin ear!\u201d\nAmong Republicans, nearly half said Clinton won and were close to evenly divided on which candidate lost, but Sanders pulled the most votes on that question.\n\"He's the new metric for \"far left\" and it's awesome!\" gloated a South Carolina Republican.\nHowever, some Republicans flagged Clinton missteps that they expect their candidates to seize on, including when she cited her Senate work on behalf of New Yorkers following the September 11 terrorist attacks as a reason she has so many Wall Street donors.\n\"HRC will be reminded of several blunders from this debate,\" said an Iowa Republican, \"not the least of which [is] throwing 9/11 up as a block to the criticism that she takes quite a bit of campaign money from Wall Street.\" \nThese are the members of the POLITICO Caucus, not all of whom participated this week:Iowa: Tim Albrecht, Brad Anderson, Rob Barron, Jeff Boeyink, Bonnie Campbell, Dave Caris, Sam Clovis, Sara Craig, Jerry Crawford, John Davis, Steve Deace, John Deeth, Derek Eadon, Ed Failor Jr., Karen Fesler, David Fischer, Doug Gross, Steve Grubbs, Tim Hagle, Bob Haus, Joe Henry, Drew Ivers, Jill June, Lori Jungling, Jeff Kaufmann, Brian Kennedy, Jake Ketzner, David Kochel, Chris Larimer, Chuck Larson, Jill Latham, Jeff Link, Dave Loebsack, Mark Lucas, Liz Mathis, Jan Michelson, Chad Olsen, David Oman, Matt Paul, Marlys Popma, Troy Price, Christopher Rants, Kim Reem, Craig Robinson, Sam Roecker, David Roederer, Nick Ryan, Tamara Scott, Joni Scotter, Karen Slifka, John Smith, AJ Spiker, Norm Sterzenbach, John Stineman, Matt Strawn, Phil Valenziano, Jessica Vanden Berg, Nate Willems, Eric Woolson, Grant Young\nNew Hampshire: Charlie Arlinghaus, Arnie Arnesen, Patrick Arnold, Rich Ashooh, Dean Barker, Juliana Bergeron, D.J.

As America's top diplomat from 2009 to 2013, she has international experience none of her rivals can match but can also be called to account for failings on her watch.\nClinton's Democratic and Republican opponents said the administration had misjudged the Middle East and underestimated Islamic State, the militant group that claimed credit for bomb and gun attacks that killed at least 132 people in Paris on Friday.\nRepublican presidential candidate Senator Lindsey Graham said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday that if he were elected, the United States would be \"part of a world-wide force to destroy ISIL,\" another acronym for Islamic State.\n\"Hillary Clinton,\" he added \"seems to be disconnected from what you need to do.

If that's the case, you have a problem,\" Rubio said.\nFellow Republican contenders, Ohio Governor John Kasich and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, have been open to accepting more refugees, but they echoed Rubio's concerns about vetting. \n\"We can't be in a position of inviting the enemy in, and frankly we better be careful about looking at Americans that have traveled\" in the region, Kasich said on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo.\"\nBush said on \"Meet the Press\" the United States had a special responsibility to help Syrian Christians, who he said had no place in their homeland.\nAhead of the first Democratic nominating contest in Iowa on Feb. 1, Clinton has opened a commanding lead over main party challenger Bernie Sanders, who argues the invasion of Iraq, which Clinton supported in a U.S. Senate vote in 2003, led to the rise of al Qaeda and Islamic State.\nFor more on the 2016 U.S. presidential race and to learn about the undecided voters who determine elections, visit the Reuters website.

But she was forced on the defensive early in the debate about her years of leading President Barack Obama's foreign policy team.\nClinton struck a sharp contrast to Obama's comments in an interview aired on Friday that ISIS had been contained.\n\"We have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network. It cannot be contained, it must be defeated,\" she said.\nRepublican presidential contenders have criticized Obama for what they say was an inadequate response to the rise of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In the aftermath of the attacks, businessman Donald Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz called on the administration to reconsider plans to allow thousands of Syrian refugees to be resettled in the United States.\nThe White House aims to increase to 10,000 the number of Syrian refugees accepted in the United States during fiscal year 2016, from less than 2,000 accepted in the previous year.\nClinton has always been from the more hawkish wing of the Democratic Party. Her support for the 2003 Iraq invasion played a major role in her primary loss to Obama in the 2008 White House race.\nThe foreign policy focus was a dramatic shift in emphasis in a Democratic presidential race that so far has been dominated by domestic economic issues such as income inequality, college affordability and family leave.\nThe Democrats returned to that theme later in the debate, and Sanders criticized Clinton for being too cozy with Wall Street and not being in favor of reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act, the 1933 law that established a firewall between investment and commercial banking.\n\"Over her political career, Wall Street has been a major, the major donor to Hillary Clinton. Now maybe they\u2019re dumb, but I don\u2019t think so,\" said Sanders, who favors reinstatement of the act.\nClinton accused Sanders of impugning her integrity and said reinstating the law was not enough to rein in corporate influence and reform Wall Street.\n\"Reinstating Glass-Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough,\" she said. \"I go after all of Wall Street, not just the big banks.\"\nWith the political clock ticking to the first nominating contest in Iowa on Feb. 1, Clinton has opened a commanding lead over Sanders, her prime challenger, in national and Iowa polls.

{"body": "Donald Trump has dramatically escalated his attacks on his nearest rival for the Republican presidential nomination, Ben Carson. A new Reuters/Ipsos poll may explain why: the billionaire real estate magnate is bleeding support among avid church-goers and women to the retired neurosurgeon. \nWhile the unconstrained Trump has a comfortable double-digit lead over the soft-spoken Carson, the data points to a possible emerging threat to Trump's hopes of capturing the party's nomination for the November 2016 election. \nThe poll of likely Republican primary voters also shows that Carson is drawing strong support from the rural Midwest, including Iowa, which holds the first Republican nominating contest on Feb. 1. Trump, in contrast, is drawing strong support in the northeast and southeast.\nThat geographical divide is significant, analysts said, because Carson's dominance in more socially conservative states like Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska reflects how his story of personal redemption is resonating strongly with evangelical voters. They traditionally play an outsize role not just in the first nominating contest in Iowa on Feb. 1, but in Nevada and South Carolina, which also hold nominating votes in February.\n\"If Carson keeps his nose clean he could win those states and could catch lightning in a bottle,\" said Ford O'Connell, a Republican strategist not affiliated with either campaign.\nTrump, who has topped national polls of likely Republican primary voters for months, has until now enjoyed strong support among the key constituency of low-income, blue-collar, church-going voters, who have been attracted by his image as a straight-talking political outsider.\nBut Carson's similar appeal as an outsider taking on the Republican establishment has undercut Trump's support in recent weeks, and Carson has surged to the top of a few recent national polls.\nCarson's growing support with women and blue collar voters may explain Trump's recent attacks on his rival, said O'Connell. Trump has highlighted media reports questioning elements of Carson's personal story, and on Thursday he called Carson \"pathological\" and likened him to a child molester.\n\n\"OUTSIDER VOTE\"\n\"Trump is desperate to consolidate the 'outsider' vote. The blue collar vote is very, very key to Trump's success in that. He has tried everything to shake Carson off and it hasn't worked, so he has decided to go nuclear,\" said O'Connell, an advisor to Republican Senator John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign.\nTo be sure, a separate rolling five-day Reuters/Ipsos poll shows Trump surging to 42 percent of likely Republican primary voters, up from 25 percent, since Nov. 6 while Carson was flat at 23 percent.\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment on the polling data. \nBarry Bennett, Carson\u2019s campaign manager, said of Trump's heightened criticism of Carson: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain his remarks but clearly he\u2019s feeling some pressure and overreacting.\u201d\nBridget Miller, 43, from Stilwell, Kansas, said she had initially considered voting for Trump, but had switched to Carson. \"Carson is pro-life; he's pro-gun; he's saved baby's lives. He speaks to a lot of our values here,\" she said.\nOther likely Republican primary voters say they initially supported Trump but his latest criticism of Carson and his \"child molester\" comments only confirmed their belief that he is unsuited to the presidency.\nJanis Anderson, 54, from Fargo, North Dakota, said she had considered Donald Trump, but his latest comments about Carson were \u201cridiculous.\u201d\nTrump still either leads or shares the lead among most geographical and demographic groups, including wealthy and middle-income voters, people with and without college degrees, the southeast, northeast, the Upper Midwest and the American West.\nBut the story is different among lower-paid workers. In September, Carson had just over 14 percent of support among voters in households with an annual income of $50,000 or less, according to the broader Reuters/Ipsos data. By the end of October, that had jumped to over 23 percent support. Trump's support in the same group was flat at around 33 percent.\nAmong likely female Republican primary voters, Carson has seen his support jump since September from about 19 to 27 percent - the highest of any Republican candidate - while Trump's has slipped from 30 percent to 25.\nCarson's support among regular churchgoers has also risen sharply, according to the Reuters/Ipsos survey, jumping 10 points between September and November to 32 percent, the highest of any Republican candidate. Trump's support with religious voters has slipped from 26 percent to 22 percent.\n\"As the campaign has evolved over time, Trump has begun to wear a little bit thin, especially voters who want a softer, more gentlemanly approach to politics,\" said David Gergen, an adviser to four former U.S. presidents from both parties. \"Carson is wearing better with women than Trump.\"\nThe surveys of likely Republican voters was taken from Sept. 1 until Oct. 31. The Reuters/Ipsos poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 to 8 percent. \n\n (Editing by Ross Colvin)", "byline": "", "description": "(Reuters) - Donald Trump has dramatically escalated his attacks on his nearest rival for the Republican presidential nomination, Ben Carson.

If that's the case, you have a problem,\" Rubio said.\nFellow Republican contenders, Ohio Governor John Kasich and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, have been open to accepting more refugees, but they echoed Rubio's concerns about vetting. \n\"We can't be in a position of inviting the enemy in, and frankly we better be careful about looking at Americans that have traveled\" in the region, Kasich said on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo.\"\nBush said on \"Meet the Press\" the United States had a special responsibility to help Syrian Christians, who he said had no place in their homeland.\nAhead of the first Democratic nominating contest in Iowa on Feb. 1, Clinton has opened a commanding lead over main party challenger Bernie Sanders, who argues the invasion of Iraq, which Clinton supported in a U.S. Senate vote in 2003, led to the rise of al Qaeda and Islamic State.\nFor more on the 2016 U.S. presidential race and to learn about the undecided voters who determine elections, visit the Reuters website.

It's become more complicated. And many of the fights that are going on are not ones that the United States has either started or have a role in,\" she said.  \nThe Iraq exchange came early in the second debate for Democrats seeking their party's nomination for the November 2016 presidential election, which focused on foreign policy and ways to combat terrorism after the Paris attacks.\nThe candidates and audience at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, observed a moment of silence at the beginning of the debate to honor those killed in France.\nClinton, the former secretary of state, has far more foreign policy experience than either Sanders or O'Malley. But she was forced on the defensive early in the debate about her years of leading President Barack Obama's foreign policy team.\nClinton struck a sharp contrast to Obama's comments in an interview aired on Friday that ISIS had been contained. \"We have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network. It cannot be contained, it must be defeated,\" she said.\nRepublican presidential contenders have criticized Obama for what they say was an inadequate response to the rise of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

Her support for the 2003 Iraq invasion played a major role in her primary loss to Obama in the 2008 White House race.\nThe foreign policy focus was a dramatic shift in emphasis in a Democratic presidential race that so far has been dominated by domestic economic issues such as income inequality, college affordability and family leave.\nThe Democrats returned to that theme later in the debate, and Sanders criticized Clinton for her opposition to reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act, the 1933 law that established a firewall between investment and commercial banking. Its removal has been blamed by some for helping lead to the 2008 financial crisis.\n\"Over her political career, Wall Street has been a major, the major donor to Hillary Clinton. Now maybe they\u2019re dumb, but I don\u2019t think so,\" said Sanders, who favors reinstatement of the act.\nClinton accused Sanders of impugning her integrity and said reinstating the law was not enough to rein in corporate influence and reform Wall Street.\n\"Reinstating Glass-Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough,\" she said. \"I just don\u2019t think it would get the job done, I\u2019m all about making sure it actually gets results for whatever we do.\u201d \nWith the political clock ticking to the first nominating contest in Iowa on Feb. 1, Clinton has opened a commanding lead over Sanders, her prime challenger, in national and Iowa polls.

{"body": "BUENOS AIRES Argentina's ruling party presidential candidate, Daniel Scioli, lagging in the opinion polls, will have to win points in Sunday night's debate against his business-friendly rival if he hopes to revive his campaign in time to win the Nov. 22 election.\nScioli, the governor of Buenos Aires province, has been endorsed by outgoing President Cristina Fernandez. Barred by law from running for a third term this year, Fernandez will leave her successor to deal with double-digit inflation, scant central bank reserves and a widening fiscal deficit.\nAt 9 p.m. (midnight GMT), in the campaign's only televised debate, Scioli will square off against Mauricio Macri, a free-markets proponent who is leading the polls by about 8 percentage points after a stronger-than-expected performance in last month's first round of voting. \nMacri promises to spur investment by quickly dismantling Fernandez's trade and currency controls. Scioli's message of gradual change toward more orthodox policies while preserving Fernandez's generous welfare programs has failed to catch fire with the middle-class swing voters who will decide the election.\n\"Scioli has to use the debate to show he is independent from Fernandez and that he has a plan for change, concentrating on economic issued like inflation and employment,\" said local pollster Mariel Fornoni. \"He already has Fernandez's supporters locked in. So he has to concentrate on undecided voters.\"\nFernandez is revered by Argentina's poor for having strengthened the social safety net during her eight years in power. But inflation sparked by her policy of printing pesos to finance an ever-wider fiscal deficit has pumped up household expenses for families across the political spectrum. \nFernandez may return as a presidential candidate in 2019. She and Scioli have never been close and her statements of support for him have been tepid.

But she was forced on the defensive early in the debate about her years of leading President Barack Obama's foreign policy team.\nClinton struck a sharp contrast to Obama's comments in an interview aired on Friday that ISIS had been contained.\n\"We have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network. It cannot be contained, it must be defeated,\" she said.\nRepublican presidential contenders have criticized Obama for what they say was an inadequate response to the rise of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In the aftermath of the attacks, businessman Donald Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz called on the administration to reconsider plans to allow thousands of Syrian refugees to be resettled in the United States.\nThe White House aims to increase to 10,000 the number of Syrian refugees accepted in the United States during fiscal year 2016, from less than 2,000 accepted in the previous year.\nClinton has always been from the more hawkish wing of the Democratic Party. Her support for the 2003 Iraq invasion played a major role in her primary loss to Obama in the 2008 White House race.\nThe foreign policy focus was a dramatic shift in emphasis in a Democratic presidential race that so far has been dominated by domestic economic issues such as income inequality, college affordability and family leave.\nThe Democrats returned to that theme later in the debate, and Sanders criticized Clinton for being too cozy with Wall Street and not being in favor of reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act, the 1933 law that established a firewall between investment and commercial banking.\n\"Over her political career, Wall Street has been a major, the major donor to Hillary Clinton.

{"body": "\nGREENVILLE, S.C.\u2013Sen. Ted Cruz brought his presidential campaign to an evangelical bastion here Saturday, travelling to a Christian college to hold a religious liberty rally that was shadowed by anxiety about the terrorist attacks in Paris.\nMr. Cruz opened the rally at Bob Jones University with a moment of silence for the victims of the attacks and called for a decisive response to the Islamic militants who claimed responsibility.\n\u201cThis is an evil that will not quietly slip away,\u201d Mr. Cruz said in his opening prayer. \u201cWe will defeat radical Islamic terrorism. This evil will no longer walk the face of the earth.\u201d\nThe focus of the rally, however, was the threat to religious freedom that many conservatives see in the U.S., an issue that is central to the Cruz campaign effort to win over evangelical voters. He is reaching out to people who believe their right to act on their religious beliefs is threatened by government actions supporting such social changes as the legalization of gay marriage and limits on public religious worship.\nAt the rally, similar one Mr. Cruz held in Iowa in August, he shared the stage with Christians who think their religious rights were violated, such as Joe Kennedy\u2013 a high school football coach in Washington state who was placed on leave recently for kneeling in silent prayer on the field after games.\n\u201cWhat kind of country have we become when kneeling in prayer is regarded as an act of civil disobedience,\u201d Mr. Cruzsaid. \u201cThese threats are real and they are growing each and every day.\u201d\nMr. Cruz\u2019s staff estimated that 2,500 people attended the rally at Bob Jones, a college that has a stirred controversy in the past for its treatment of blacks and gays. The school\u2019s ban on interracial dating sparked criticism of George W. Bush when he campaigned here during the 2000 presidential campaign. That ban subsequently ended, and the college is reemerging as a destination for GOP presidential candidates seeking evangelical support.\nOne of Mr. Cruz\u2019s leading rivals for support of evangelical voters, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, appeared on the campus Friday for a town hall meeting with South Carolina GOP Sen. Tim Scott.\nThe two presidential candidates provided the community with a study in contrast: Mr. Cruz gave a fiery, emotional speech that filled an auditorium; Mr. Carson was more measured and low key.\nFor some in the audience, the violence in Paris led them to focus more acutely on the candidates\u2019 ability to lead in a world crisis and prosecute a war on terrorism. For Janessa Fortner, a Greenville Republican who is inclined to support businessman Donald Trump, those developments raised new reservations in her mind about the low key Mr. Carson.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to strike fear in ISIS,\u201d Mrs. Fortner said. \u201cWho would you want handling what happened last night?\u2019\u2019\n______________________________________________________\n2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll Standings\n\n\nPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops. \r\n\nCapital Journal Daybreak Newsletter: Sign up to get the latest on politics, policy and defense delivered to your inbox every morning.\r\nFor the latest Washington news, follow @wsjpolitics\r\nFor outside analysis, follow @wsjthinktank", "byline": "", "description": "Sen.

{"body": "Democrats and Republicans, based on their recent presidential debates, are set to offer voters a stark choice in 2016 about how the economy should be managed, with both sides moving toward the outer flanks of their parties.\nIn Saturday\u2019s Democratic debate, candidates said they would seek to rein in Wall Street, raise taxes, increase the minimum wage and expand the federal government\u2019s role in health care. Republicans, meanwhile, are competing to repeal regulations, cut taxes, keep the minimum wage as it stands and roll back President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health-care overhaul.\nThe parties right now \u201chave polar opposite analyses of how the economy works and how it should work,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser in the Obama administration. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious but underappreciated how far apart they are on the fundamentals\u2014wages, taxes, financial markets.\u201d\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top challenger, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, sparred Saturday over how to pay for new federal investments in education, infrastructure and health care. Both called for raising taxes on the wealthy, although Mrs. Clinton pledged to do so without hitting families that earn less than $250,000 or increasing deficits, which would constrain new spending ambitions.\nMr. Sanders wouldn\u2019t say exactly how high tax rates should rise but noted the top tax rate had been 91% in the 1950s under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican. \u201cI\u2019m not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,\u201d Mr. Sanders said.\nRepublicans have put tax-cutting proposals at the heart of their economic policy agenda, and they have largely shied away from promises made by candidates four years ago to avoid running up budget deficits.\nThe boldness of some proposals drew warnings from one candidate, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, at last week\u2019s Republican presidential debate. \u201cHillary and the Democrats promise everything on the spending side. We\u2019ve got to be responsible about what we propose on the tax side,\u201d he said.\nRepublicans at last week\u2019s debate also dismissed efforts to boost the federal minimum wage, now at $7.25 an hour, as an ineffective way to raise incomes. Florida Sen.  Marco Rubio and businessman  Donald Trump said it would put U.S. workers at a disadvantage. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make people more expensive than a machine,\u201d Mr. Rubio said.\nDemocrats on Saturday debated whether to target a federal minimum wage of $12 or $15 an hour. Mr. Sanders supports the higher threshold, an effort backed by labor unions. He brushed aside warnings issued recently by Alan Krueger, the Princeton University professor who served as Mr. Obama\u2019s top economist, that a $15 minimum wage is an untested, risky level. His research contends minimum-wage increases haven\u2019t decreased employment, and he supports raising wages to $12 an hour.\n\u201cI do take what Alan Krueger said seriously,\u201d said Mrs. Clinton, who also has endorsed the $12 floor.\nMr. Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley, the third candidate at Saturday\u2019s debate and a former Maryland governor, said they would shun anyone with Wall Street ties from top positions in their administrations, including figures such as  Robert Rubin and Larry Summers, who served as treasury secretaries for President  Bill Clinton.\nSome Democrats have faulted that approach. \u201cThe idea that you have to excommunicate anybody who ever worked in the financial sector is ridiculous,\u201d said Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist Democratic think tank. \u201cWe need people who oversee the Federal Reserve system and have high posts at Treasury that have expertise in finance.\u201d\nBoth Republicans and Democrats have promised to crack down on Wall Street, but they disagree sharply over how to do it. Republicans generally have blamed government policies, from housing to Federal Reserve interest-rate decisions, for provoking the financial crisis. They say the Dodd-Frank Act in particular has restrained economic growth and should be repealed.\nDemocrats quarreled Saturday over whether the regulatory overhaul had gone far enough by failing to reinstate a New Deal-era law that separated commercial and investment banking, known as the Glass-Steagall Act.\nThe flare-up over banking laws reflected Mr. Sanders\u2019s broader critique that Democrats and Republicans have given banks too much political power, a throwback to the \u201ctrust busting\u201d of President Theodore Roosevelt more than a century ago. Why do big industries make \u201cmillions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something,\u201d he said in Saturday\u2019s debate. \u201cEverybody knows that.\u201d\nBoth parties did agree in the past week on one thing: the virtues of community banks. Republicans warned that too many were going out of business. Mr. Sanders said Saturday that they needed more support. \u201cThat\u2019s the future of banking in America,\u201d he said.\nWrite to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com", "byline": "", "description": "Democrats and Republicans, based on their recent presidential debates, are set to offer voters a stark choice in 2016 about how the economy should be managed, with both sides moving toward the outer flanks of their parties.", "title": "Parties' Divide on Economy Widens", "url": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/parties-divide-on-the-economy-widens-1447633374", "topics": ["economy"], "people": ["Theodore Roosevelt", "Martin O'Malley", "Alan Krueger", "Bill Clinton", "Hillary Clinton", "Dwight D.

{"body": "Hillary Clinton defended herself against criticism over the\u00a0money she has\u00a0raised from the financial industry\u00a0by invoking her job as a U.S. senator representing New York after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\u201cI did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York,\u201d she said, after finding herself again on the defensive over her perceived close ties to Wall Street. \u201cIt was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.\u201d\nThe unusual defense emerged during a feisty exchange over financial-industry regulation in\u00a0Saturday\u2019s\u00a0Democratic presidential debate hosted by CBS News. Mrs. Clinton also noted that 60% of her donors are women\u2014another effort to turn back the Wall Street fundraising attack from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who has emerged as a formidable opponent in the Democratic primary.\nJust as in last month\u2019s Democratic debate, the discussion Saturday of financial regulation turned largely on whether Congress should reinstate the New Deal-era banking law, the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated investment banking from commercial banking. President Bill Clinton played a major role ushering in legislation, signed into law in 1999, that repealed Glass-Steagall.\nSome critics say Glass-Steagall facilitated the financial crisis in 2008 by allowing large banks to grow, in effect, \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d forcing the unpopular emergency bailouts. They have pushed legislation to carve up the banks by instating aspects of Glass-Steagall, which the banking industry strongly opposes. Mr. Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley both endorsed that effort again\u00a0on Saturday.\nMrs. Clinton was more restrained. \u201cReinstating Glass-Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough,\u201d she said, adding that her regulatory-overhaul proposal is \u201ctougher, more effective, and more comprehensive,\u201d because it would target nonbank institutions as well as Wall Street banks and large depository institutions.\nMrs. Clinton implied that Glass-Steagall would have done little to forestall the bank bailouts in 2008 because many of the companies that either failed or required bailouts\u2014including American International Group and Lehman Brothers\u2014weren\u2019t big deposit-taking banks. AIG is an insurance company and Lehman Brothers was a standalone investment bank.\nCritics of the Glass-Steagall repeal don\u2019t agree with this view. They say it too easily overlooks the ways in which banks, particularly Citigroup, took on greater risks that fed increased risk-taking across Wall Street. AIG, for example, got into trouble because it had insured billions of financial products issued by more than a dozen firms\u2014some that had grown thanks to Glass-Steagall and some that, like Lehman and Bear Stearns, had remained standalone investment banks.\nStepping back from the bank-regulation arcana, there\u2019s a broader disagreement here. At the heart of Mr. Sanders\u2019s argument over the size of banks is the idea that they have too much political power, an idea that\u00a0evokes the \u201ctrust busting\u201d of President Teddy Roosevelt who sought to break up big industrial monopolies for some of the same reasons.\nWhy do big industries make \u201cmillions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something. Everybody knows that,\u201d said Mr. Sanders.\nWhen Mrs. Clinton said that she would break up banks if they didn\u2019t play by the rules, Mr. Sanders responded with disbelief that this might be in doubt. \u201cThe business model of Wall Street is fraud,\u201d he said.\nMr. Sanders pledged not to have any Wall Street representatives in his cabinet. \u201cOne of the problems we\u2019ve had\u2026whether it\u2019s Republican administrations or Democratic administrations, we have seen Wall Street and Goldman Sachs dominate administrations,\u201d he said.\nMr. O\u2019Malley joined in when he said that Richard Rubin and Larry Summers, both former treasury secretaries for President Bill Clinton, wouldn\u2019t be allowed near his administration. Mr. Rubin has been a very influential figure within Democratic policymaking for the last two decades, and many policymakers that he has mentored have served in top positions for President Barack Obama.\n\u201cThey are the architects,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Malley.\nMr. O\u2019Malley was pressed to name who, exactly, would provide him with advise on financial regulation. He didn\u2019t provide any names. \u201cWe\u2019ll have an inclusive group,\u201d he said.\nFinancial regulation also emerged as a hot topic in\u00a0Tuesday\u2019s\u00a0Republican debate, and it showed how both parties have vastly different interpretations of what caused the financial crisis and, consequently, what should be done to prevent it from happening again.\nRepublicans generally have blamed government policies, from housing to the Federal Reserve, for provoking risk-taking, an idea that draws mixed readings from economists. They say that there is now too much government regulation, singling out for criticism the Dodd-Frank financial-regulatory overhaul, even though they have also tried to sound critical of Wall Street.\nThe clear winner in both the GOP debate earlier this week and in\u00a0Saturday\u2019s\u00a0Democratic debate: community banks.\n\u201cImagine America without its community banks.
